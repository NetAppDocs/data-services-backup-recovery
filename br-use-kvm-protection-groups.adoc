Create protection groups to manage the backup operations for a set of KVM resources. A protection group is a logical grouping of resources such as VMs and storage pools that you want to protect together. You need to create a protection group to back up KVM virtual machines or storage pools.

You can perform the following tasks related to protection groups:

* Create a protection group.
* View protection details. 
* Back up a protection group now. See link:br-use-kvm-backup.html[Back up KVM workloads now].
//* Suspend and resume a protection group's backup schedule. 
* Edit a protection group. 
* Delete a protection group.

== Suspend a protection group's backup schedule

Suspending a protection group pauses the scheduled backups for the protection group. You might want to suspend a protection group if you want to temporarily stop backups for the workloads in that group. 

The protection status changes to "Under maintenance" when you suspend a protection group. You can resume the backup schedule at any time.

.Steps
. From the NetApp Backup and Recovery menu, select *Inventory*.

== Resume a protection group's backup schedule

Resuming a suspended protection group restarts the scheduled backups for the protection group.  

The protection status changes from "Under maintenance" when you suspend a protection group to "Protected" when you resume it. You can resume the backup schedule at any time.

.Steps
