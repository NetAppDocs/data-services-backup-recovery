Restore KVM virtual machines from a protection group backup replicated to secondary storage using NetApp Backup and Recovery. 

//Restore KVM virtual machines from snapshot copies, from a protection group backup replicated to secondary storage, or from backups stored in object storage using NetApp Backup and Recovery.

//You can restore a workload to the original working environment, to a different working environment that's using the same cloud account, or to an on-premises ONTAP system. 

//different types of restore operations, volume restore or file/folder restore, Browse and restore vs Search and restore)

.Restore from these locations

You can restore virtual machines from different starting locations: 

//* Restore from a primary location (local snapshot)
* Restore from a replicated resource on secondary storage
//* Restore from an object storage backup

.Restore to these points   

You can restore data to the original location; restoring to an alternate location is not available in this Preview release.

//* Restore to the original location
//* Restore to an alternate location

//.Restore from object storage considerations

//If you select a backup file in object storage, and ransomware protection is active for that backup (if you enabled DataLock and Ransomware Protection in the backup policy), then you are prompted to run an additional integrity check on the backup file before restoring the data. We recommend that you perform the scan. 

//TIP: You'll incur extra egress costs from your cloud provider to access the contents of the backup file.


== How restoring virtual machines works

When you restore virtual machines, the following occurs: 

//* When you restore a workload from a local backup file, NetApp Backup and Recovery creates a _new_ resource using the data from the backup. 

* When you restore from a replicated VM, you can restore it to the original system or to an on-premises ONTAP system.
//+
//image:diagram_browse_restore_volume-unified.png["A diagram that shows the flow to restore a resource"]

//* When you restore a backup from object storage, you can restore the data to the original system or to an on-premises ONTAP system.


//== When to use Quick Restore 

//When you restore a cloud backup to a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system using ONTAP 9.13.0 or greater or to an on-premises ONTAP system running ONTAP 9.14.1, you'll have the option to perform a _quick restore_ operation. The quick restore is ideal for disaster recovery situations where you need to provide access to a resource as soon as possible. A quick restore restores the metadata from the backup file instead of restoring the entire backup file. Quick restore is not recommended for performance or latency-sensitive applications, and it is not supported with backups in archived storage.

//NOTE: Quick restore is supported for FlexGroup volumes only if the source system from which the cloud backup was created was running ONTAP 9.12.1 or greater. And it is supported for SnapLock volumes only if the source system was running ONTAP 9.11.0 or greater.


//== Restore methods

//You can restore workloads using one of the following methods. Typically, choose a method based on your restore needs:

From the Restore page (also known as Search & Restore), you can restore a VM, even if you don't remember the exact name, the location in which it resides, or the date when it was last in good shape. You can search for the snapshot using filters. 

//* *From the Inventory page (also known as Browse & Restore)*: Use this when you need to restore a specific resource from the last week or month -- and you know the name and location of the resource, and the date when it was last in good shape. You browse through a list of resources to find the one you want to restore.

//Inventory is browse and restore. Restore page is Search and restore. 

== Restore VMs from the Restore option (Search & Restore)

Restore KVM virtual machines using the Restore option. You can search for the snapshot by its name or by using filters. 

*Required Console role*
