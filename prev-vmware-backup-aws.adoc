You can back up and archive one or more datastores with NetApp Backup and Recovery to Amazon Web Services to improve storage efficiency and cloud transition.

If the datastore is associated with an archival policy, you have an option to select the archival tier. The supported archival tiers are Glacier and Glacier Deep.

.Before you begin
Ensure that you have met all the link:prev-vmware-prereqs.html[virtual machine protection requirements] before backing up datastores to the cloud.

.Steps

. In the Console UI, select *Protection* > *Backup and Recovery* > *Virtual Machines*.
. Select image:icon-action.png[action] corresponding to the datastore that you want to back up and click *Activate Backup*.
. In the Assign Policy page, select the policy and select *Next*.
. Add the system.
+
Configure the cluster management LIF that you want the Console to discover. After adding the system for one of the datastores, it can be reused for all the other datastores residing on the same ONTAP cluster.
+
.. Select *Add system* corresponding to the SVM.
.. In the Add system wizard:
... Specify the IP address of the cluster management LIF.
... Specify the credentials of the ONTAP cluster user.
.. Select *Add system*.
. Select *Amazon Web Services* to configure it as the cloud provider.
.. Specify the AWS account.
.. In the AWS Access Key field, specify the key for data encryption.
.. In the AWS Secret Key field, specify the password for data encryption.
.. Select the region where you want to create the backups.
.. Specify the IP addresses of the cluster management LIF that were added as the systems.
.. Select the archival tier.
+
It is recommended to set the archival tier because this is an one time activity and you cannot set it up later.
. Review the details and select *Activate Backup*.
