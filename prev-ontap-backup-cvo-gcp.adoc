====
*NOTE*   To switch to and from NetApp Backup and Recovery workloads, refer to link:br-start-switch-ui.html[Switch to different NetApp Backup and Recovery workloads].
====

== Verify support for your configuration

Read the following requirements to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you start backing up volumes to Google Cloud Storage.

The following image shows each component and the connections that you need to prepare between them. 

Optionally, you can connect to a secondary ONTAP system for replicated volumes using the public or private connection as well.

image:diagram_cloud_backup_cvo_google.png[A diagram showing how NetApp Backup and Recovery communicates with the volumes on the source system and the destination storage where the backup files are located.]

Supported ONTAP versions::
Minimum of ONTAP 9.8; ONTAP 9.8P13 and later is recommended.

Supported GCP regions::
NetApp Backup and Recovery is supported in all GCP regions.

GCP Service Account::
You need to have a service account in your Google Cloud Project that has the custom role. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storage-management-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-creating-gcp-service-account.html[Learn how to create a service account^].

NOTE: The Storage Admin role is no longer required for the service account that enables NetApp Backup and Recovery to access Google Cloud Storage buckets. 

== Verify license requirements

For NetApp Backup and Recovery PAYGO licensing, a Console subscription is available in the Google Marketplace that enables deployments of Cloud Volumes ONTAP and NetApp Backup and Recovery. You need to https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/netapp-cloudmanager/cloud-manager?supportedpurview=project[subscribe to this Console subscription^] before you enable NetApp Backup and Recovery. Billing for NetApp Backup and Recovery is done through this subscription. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storage-management-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-deploying-gcp.html[You can subscribe from the Details & Credentials page of the system wizard^].

For NetApp Backup and Recovery BYOL licensing, you need the serial number from NetApp that enables you to use the service for the duration and capacity of the license. link:br-start-licensing.html[Learn how to manage your BYOL licenses].

And you need to have a Google subscription for the storage space where your backups will be located.

== Prepare your Console agent

The Console agent must be installed in a Google region with internet access.

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[Learn about Console agents^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-google.html[Deploy a Console agent in Google Cloud^]

=== Verify or add permissions to the Console agent

To use the NetApp Backup and Recovery "Search & Restore" functionality, you need to have specific permissions in the role for the Console agent so that it can access the Google Cloud BigQuery service. See the permissions below, and follow the steps if you need to modify the policy.

.Steps

. In the https://console.cloud.google.com[Google Cloud Console^], go to the *Roles* page.

. Using the drop-down list at the top of the page, select the project or organization that contains the role that you want to edit.

. Select a custom role.

. Select *Edit Role* to update the role's permissions.

. Select *Add Permissions* to add the following new permissions to the role.
+
[source,json]
bigquery.jobs.get
bigquery.jobs.list
bigquery.jobs.listAll
bigquery.datasets.create
bigquery.datasets.get
bigquery.jobs.create
bigquery.tables.get
bigquery.tables.getData
bigquery.tables.list
bigquery.tables.create

. Select *Update* to save the edited role.

=== Required information for using customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK)

You can use your own customer-managed keys for data encryption instead of using the default Google-managed encryption keys. Both cross-region and cross-project keys are supported, so you can choose a project for a bucket that is different than the project of the CMEK key. If you're planning to use your own customer-managed keys: 

* You'll need to have the Key Ring and the Key Name so you can add this information in the activation wizard. https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/cmek[Learn more about customer-managed encryption keys^].

* You'll need to verify that these required permissions are included in the role for the Console agent:

[source,json]
cloudkms.cryptoKeys.get
cloudkms.cryptoKeys.getIamPolicy
cloudkms.cryptoKeys.list
cloudkms.cryptoKeys.setIamPolicy
cloudkms.keyRings.get
cloudkms.keyRings.getIamPolicy
cloudkms.keyRings.list
cloudkms.keyRings.setIamPolicy

* You'll need to verify that the Google "Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)" API is enabled in your project. See the https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/getting-started#enabling_apis[Google Cloud documentation: Enabling APIs^] for details.

*CMEK considerations:*

** Both HSM (hardware-backed) and software-generated keys are supported.
** Both newly created or imported Cloud KMS keys are supported.
** Only regional keys are supported; global keys are not supported.
** Currently, only the "Symmetric encrypt/decrypt" purpose is supported.
** The service agent associated with the Storage Account is assigned the "CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter (roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter)" IAM role by NetApp Backup and Recovery. 

=== Create your own buckets

By default, the service creates buckets for you. If you want to use your own buckets, you can create them before you start the backup activation wizard and then select those buckets in the wizard. 

link:prev-ontap-protect-journey.html[Learn more about creating your own buckets].

==  Verify ONTAP networking requirements for replicating volumes

//This section uses an Include for all providers. It includes "Cloud Volumes ONTAP networking requirements", and "On-premises ONTAP networking requirements"   

include::../_include/backup-onprem-prepare-source-destination-systems-for-repl.adoc[]

//The following statement applies only to backup from CVO topics: 
* To replicate data between two Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in different subnets, the subnets must be routed together (this is the default setting).

== Enable NetApp Backup and Recovery on Cloud Volumes ONTAP

Enabling NetApp Backup and Recovery steps differ slightly depending on whether you have an existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP system or a new one. 

*Enable NetApp Backup and Recovery on a new system*

NetApp Backup and Recovery can be enabled when you complete the system wizard to create a new Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

You must have a Service Account already configured. If you don't select a service account when you create the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system, then you'll need to turn off the system and add the service account to Cloud Volumes ONTAP from the GCP console.

See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storage-management-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-deploying-gcp.html[Launching Cloud Volumes ONTAP in GCP^] for requirements and details for creating your Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

.Steps

. From the Console *Systems* page, select *Add system*, choose the cloud provider, and select *Add New*. Select *Create Cloud Volumes ONTAP*.

. *Choose a Location*: Select *Google Cloud Platform*.

. *Choose Type*: Select *Cloud Volumes ONTAP* (either single-node or high-availability).

. *Details & Credentials*: Enter the following information:
.. Click *Edit Project* and select a new project if the one you want to use is different than the default Project (where the Console agent resides).
.. Specify the cluster name.
.. Enable the *Service Account* switch and select the Service Account that has the predefined Storage Admin role. This is required to enable backups and tiering.
.. Specify the credentials.
+
Make sure that a GCP Marketplace subscription is in place.
//+
//image:screenshot_backup_to_gcp_new_env.png[Screenshot that shows how to enable a Service Account in the system wizard.]

. *Services*: Leave NetApp Backup and Recovery enabled and click *Continue*.

. Complete the pages in the wizard to deploy the system as described in https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storage-management-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-deploying-gcp.html[Launching Cloud Volumes ONTAP in GCP^].



.Result

NetApp Backup and Recovery is enabled on the system. After you've created volumes on these Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems, launch NetApp Backup and Recovery and link:prev-ontap-backup-manage.html[activate backup on each volume that you want to protect].
//NetApp Backup and Recovery is enabled on the system and backs up volumes every day and retains the most recent 30 backup copies.

*Enable NetApp Backup and Recovery on an existing system*

You can enable NetApp Backup and Recovery at any time directly from the system.

.Steps

. From the Console *Systems* page, select the system and select *Enable* next to Backup and Recovery in the right-panel.
+
If the Google Cloud Storage destination for your backups exists as a system on the Console *Systems* page, you can drag the cluster onto the Google Cloud Storage system to initiate the setup wizard.



== Prepare Google Cloud Storage as your backup target

Preparing Google Cloud Storage as your backup target involves the following steps: 

* Set up permissions.
* (Optional) Create your own buckets. (The service will create buckets for you if you want.)
* (Optional) Set up customer-managed keys for data encryption
//* Configure your system for a private connection using a VPC endpoint interface 

//This section is the same as backup onprem to GSP but without onprem info. 

=== Set up permissions

You need to provide storage access keys for a service account that has specific permissions using a custom role. A service account enables NetApp Backup and Recovery to authenticate and access Cloud Storage buckets used to store backups. The keys are required so that Google Cloud Storage knows who is making the request.

.Steps

. In the https://console.cloud.google.com[Google Cloud Console^], go to the *Roles* page.

. https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-custom-roles#creating_a_custom_role[Create a new role^] with the following permissions:
+
[source,json]
storage.buckets.create
storage.buckets.delete
storage.buckets.get
storage.buckets.list
storage.buckets.update
storage.buckets.getIamPolicy
storage.multipartUploads.create
storage.objects.create
storage.objects.delete
storage.objects.get
storage.objects.list
storage.objects.update

. In the Google Cloud console, https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts[go to the Service accounts page^].

. Select your Cloud project.

. Select *Create service account* and provide the required information:

.. *Service account details*: Enter a name and description.
.. *Grant this service account access to project*: Select the custom role that you just created.
.. Select *Done*.

. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/settings[GCP Storage Settings^] and create access keys for the service account:

.. Select a project, and select *Interoperability*. If you haven't already done so, select *Enable interoperability access*.

.. Under *Access keys for service accounts*, select *Create a key for a service account*, select the service account that you just created, and click *Create Key*.
+
You'll need to enter the keys in NetApp Backup and Recovery later when you configure the backup service.

=== Create your own buckets

By default, the service creates buckets for you. Or, if you want to use your own buckets, you can create them before you start the backup activation wizard and then select those buckets in the wizard.

link:prev-ontap-protect-journey.html[Learn more about creating your own buckets].

=== Set up customer-managed encryption keys (CMEK) for data encryption

You can use your own customer-managed keys for data encryption instead of using the default Google-managed encryption keys. Both cross-region and cross-project keys are supported, so you can choose a project for a bucket that is different than the project of the CMEK key. 

If you're planning to use your own customer-managed keys: 

* You'll need to have the Key Ring and the Key Name so you can add this information in the activation wizard. https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/cmek[Learn more about customer-managed encryption keys^].

* You'll need to verify that these required permissions are included in the role for the Console agent:
+
[source,json]
cloudkms.cryptoKeys.get
cloudkms.cryptoKeys.getIamPolicy
cloudkms.cryptoKeys.list
cloudkms.cryptoKeys.setIamPolicy
cloudkms.keyRings.get
cloudkms.keyRings.getIamPolicy
cloudkms.keyRings.list
cloudkms.keyRings.setIamPolicy

* You'll need to verify that the Google "Cloud Key Management Service (KMS)" API is enabled in your project. See the https://cloud.google.com/apis/docs/getting-started#enabling_apis[Google Cloud documentation: Enabling APIs^] for details.

*CMEK considerations:*

* Both HSM (Hardware-backed) and Software-generated keys are supported.

* The service agent associated with the Storage Account is assigned the "CryptoKey Encrypter/Decrypter (roles/cloudkms.cryptoKeyEncrypterDecrypter)" IAM role by NetApp Backup and Recovery. 






== Activate backups on your ONTAP volumes 

Activate backups at any time directly from your on-premises system.

A wizard takes you through the following major steps: 

* <<Select the volumes that you want to back up>>
* <<Define the backup strategy>>
* <<Review your selections>> 

You can also <<Show the API commands>> at the review step, so you can copy the code to automate backup activation for future systems.  

=== Start the wizard 

.Steps 

. Access the Activate backup and recovery wizard using one of the following ways: 
* From the Console *Systems* page*, select the system and select *Enable > Backup Volumes* next to Backup and Recovery in the right-panel.

+
If the GCP destination for your backups exists as a system on the Console *Systems* page, you can drag the ONTAP cluster onto the GCP object storage.  
* Select *Volumes* in the Backup and Recovery bar. From the Volumes tab, select the *Actions* image:icon-action.png["Actions icon"] icon and select *Activate Backup* for a single volume (that does not already have replication or backup to object storage already enabled).  

+ 
The Introduction page of the wizard shows the protection options including local Snapshots, replication, and backups. If you did the second option in this step, the Define Backup Strategy page appears with one volume selected. 

. Continue with the following options: 

* If you already have a Console agent, you're all set. Just select *Next*. 
* If you don't already have a Console agent, the *Add a Console agent* option appears. Refer to <<Prepare your Console agent>>. 

=== Select the volumes that you want to back up

Choose the volumes you want to protect. A protected volume is one that has one or more of the following: Snapshot policy, replication policy, backup to object policy. 

You can choose to protect FlexVol or FlexGroup volumes; however, you cannot select a mix of these volumes when activating backup for a system. See how to link:prev-ontap-backup-manage.html[activate backup for additional volumes in the system] (FlexVol or FlexGroup) after you have configured backup for the initial volumes.

[NOTE] 
====
* You can activate a backup only on a single FlexGroup volume at a time. 
* The volumes you select must have the same SnapLock setting. All volumes must have SnapLock Enterprise enabled or have SnapLock disabled. 
//(Volumes with SnapLock Compliance mode require ONTAP 9.14 or later.)
====

.Steps 

Note that if the volumes you choose already have Snapshot or replication policies applied, then the policies you select later will overwrite these existing policies. 

. In the Select Volumes page, select the volume or volumes you want to protect. 
+
* Optionally, filter the rows to show only volumes with certain volume types, styles, and more to make the selection easier. 
* After you select the first volume, then you can select all FlexVol volumes (FlexGroup volumes can be selected one at a time only). To back up all existing FlexVol volumes, check one volume first and then check the box in the title row. 
* To back up individual volumes, check the box for each volume.
. Select *Next*.

=== Define the backup strategy 

Defining the backup strategy involves setting the following options: 

* Whether you want one or all of the backup options: local Snapshots, replication, and backup to object storage
* Architecture
* Local snapshot policy
* Replication target and policy
+
NOTE: If the volumes you choose have different Snapshot and replication policies than the policies you select in this step, the existing policies will be overwritten. 

* Backup to object storage information (provider, encryption, networking, backup policy, and export options). 

.Steps 

. In the Define backup strategy page, choose one or all of the following. All three are selected by default: 
+
* *Local Snapshots*: If you are performing replication or back up to object storage, local snapshots must be created. 
* *Replication*: Creates replicated volumes on another ONTAP storage system.  
* *Backup*: Backs up volumes to object storage.  

. *Architecture*: If you chose replication and backup, choose one of the following flows of information: 
* *Cascading*: Information flows from the primary storage system to the secondary, and from secondary to object storage. 
* *Fan out*: Information flows from the primary storage system to the secondary _and_ from the primary to object storage. 
+ 
For details about these architectures, refer to link:prev-ontap-protect-journey.html[Plan your protection journey]. 
 
. *Local Snapshot*: Choose an existing snapshot policy or create one. 
+
TIP: To create a custom policy before activating the backup, refer to link:br-use-policies-create.html[Create a policy].
+
To create a policy, select *Create new policy* and do the following: 
+
** Enter the name of the policy. 
** Select up to five schedules, typically of different frequencies. 
** For backup-to-object policies, configure Datalock and Ransomware Resilience. For details on Datalock and Ransomware Resilience, refer to link:prev-ontap-policy-object-options.html[Backup-to-object policy settings].
** Select *Create*. 
. *Replication*: Set the following options: 
+
* *Replication target*: Select the destination system and SVM. Optionally, select the destination aggregate or aggregates and prefix or suffix that will be added to the replicated volume name. 
* *Replication policy*: Choose an existing replication policy or create one. 
+
TIP: To create a custom policy before activating the replication, refer to link:br-use-policies-create.html[Create a policy].
+
To create a policy, select *Create new policy* and do the following: 
+
** Enter the name of the policy. 
** Select up to five schedules, typically of different frequencies. 
** Select *Create*. 

. *Back up to Object*: If you selected *Backup*, set the following options: 
+
* *Provider*: Select *Google Cloud*. 
* *Provider settings*: Enter the provider details and region where the backups will be stored.
+ 
Either create a new bucket or select an existing one. 

* *Encryption key*: If you created a new Google bucket, enter encryption key information given to you from the provider. Choose whether you'll use the default Google Cloud encryption keys, or choose your own customer-managed keys from your Google account, to manage encryption of your data. 

+ 
If you choose to use your own customer-managed keys, enter the key vault and key information. 

+ 
NOTE: If you chose an existing Google Cloud bucket, encryption information is already available, so you don't need to enter it now. 

* *Backup policy*: Select an existing backup-to-object storage policy or create one.
+
TIP: To create a custom policy before activating the backup, refer to link:br-use-policies-create.html[Create a policy].
+
To create a policy, select *Create new policy* and do the following: 
+
** Enter the name of the policy. 
** Select up to five schedules, typically of different frequencies. 
** Select *Create*. 


* *Export existing Snapshot copies to object storage as backup copies*: If there are any local Snapshot copies for volumes in this system that match the backup schedule label you just selected for this system (for example, daily, weekly, etc.), this additional prompt is displayed. Check this box to have all historic Snapshots copied to object storage as backup files to ensure the most complete protection for your volumes.

. Select *Next*. 

//.. Enter the name for the default policy. You don't need to change the name.
//.. Define the backup schedule and choose the number of backups to retain. link:concept-ontap-backup-to-cloud.html#customizable-backup-schedule-and-retention-settings[See the list of existing policies you can choose^].

//.. Optionally, when using ONTAP 9.11.1 and greater, you can choose to protect your backups from deletion and ransomware attacks by configuring one of the _DataLock and Ransomware Resilience_ settings. _DataLock_ protects your backup files from being modified or deleted, and _Ransomware protection_ scans your backup files to look for evidence of a ransomware attack in your backup files. link:concept-cloud-backup-policies.html#datalock-and-ransomware-protection[Learn more about the available DataLock settings^].
//+
//NOTE: If you plan to use DataLock, you must enable it in your first policy when activating NetApp Backup and Recovery. You might want to protect your backups from deletion by using _DataLock_.

//.. Optionally, when using ONTAP 9.10.1 and greater, you can choose to tier backups to either S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage after a certain number of days for further cost optimization. link:reference-aws-backup-tiers.html[Learn more about using archival tiers^].

=== Review your selections 

This is the chance to review your selections and make adjustments, if necessary. 

.Steps 

. In the Review page, review your selections. 
. Optionally check the box to *Automatically synchronize the Snapshot policy labels with the replication and backup policy labels*. This creates Snapshots with a label that matches the labels in the replication and backup policies.  
. Select *Activate Backup*. 

.Result 

NetApp Backup and Recovery starts taking the initial backups of your volumes. The baseline transfer of the replicated volume and the backup file includes a full copy of the primary storage system data. Subsequent transfers contain differential copies of the primary storage system data contained in Snapshot copies.

A replicated volume is created in the destination cluster that will be synchronized with the primary storage system volume. 

A Google Cloud Storage bucket is created in the service account indicated by the Google access key and secret key you entered, and the backup files are stored there. 

Backups are associated with the _Standard_ storage class by default. You can use the lower cost _Nearline_, _Coldline_, or _Archive_ storage classes. However, you configure the storage class through Google, not through the NetApp Backup and Recovery UI. See the Google topic https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/changing-default-storage-class[Changing the default storage class of a bucket^] for details.

The Volume Backup Dashboard is displayed so you can monitor the state of the backups. 

You can also monitor the status of backup and restore jobs using the link:br-use-monitor-tasks.html[Job Monitoring page].

=== Show the API commands 

You might want to display and optionally copy the API commands used in the Activate backup and recovery wizard. You might want to do this to automate backup activation in future systems. 

.Steps 

. From the Activate backup and recovery wizard, select *View API request*. 
. To copy the commands to the clipboard, select the *Copy* icon.
