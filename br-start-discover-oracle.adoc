NetApp Backup and Recovery needs to first discover your Oracle databases so that you can protect them.


*Required Console role*
Backup and Recovery super admin. Learn about link:reference-roles.html[Backup and recovery roles and privileges]. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about NetApp Console access roles for all services^].

== Add an Oracle host and discover resources

Add Oracle host information and let NetApp Backup and Recovery discover workloads. Within each Console agent, select the systems where you want to discover workloads.  

.Steps

. From the NetApp Console menu, select *Protection > Backup and Recovery*.
. Under *Workloads*, select the *Oracle* tile.
+
If you are logging in to Backup and Recovery for the first time and have a system in the Console but no discovered resources, the _Welcome to the new NetApp Backup and Recovery_ page appears with an option to *Discover resources*. 

. Select *Discover resources*.

. Enter the following information: 
.. *Workload type*: Select *Oracle*.
.. If you haven't yet stored credentials for this Oracle host, select *Add credentials*.
... Select the Console agent to use with this host.
... Enter a name for this credential.
... Enter the user name and password for the account.
... Select *Done*.
.. *Host registration*: Add a new Oracle host. Enter the host's FQDN or IP address, credentials, Console agent, and port number.
. Select *Discover*. 
+
TIP: This process might take a few minutes.

.Result
The Oracle workload is displayed in the list of workloads on the Inventory page.

== Continue to the NetApp Backup and Recovery Dashboard

. From the NetApp Console menu, select *Protection* > *Backup and recovery*.
. Select a workload tile (for example, Microsoft SQL Server).
. From the Backup and Recovery menu, select *Dashboard*.
. Review the health of data protection. The number of at risk or protected workloads increases based on the newly discovered, protected, and backed up workloads.
