[.lead]
Complete a few steps in NetApp Backup and Recovery to get started backing up volume data from your Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems to Amazon S3.


====
*NOTE*   To switch to and from NetApp Backup and Recovery workloads, refer to link:br-start-switch-ui.html[Switch to different NetApp Backup and Recovery workloads].
====




== Verify support for your configuration

Read the following requirements to make sure that you have a supported configuration before you start backing up volumes to S3.

The following image shows each component and the connections that you need to prepare between them.

Optionally, you can connect to a secondary ONTAP system for replicated volumes using the public or private connection as well.

image:diagram_cloud_backup_cvo_aws.png[A diagram showing how NetApp Backup and Recovery communicates with the volumes on the source systems and the destination storage where the backup files are located.]

The VPC gateway endpoint must exist in your VPC already. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints-s3.html[Learn more about gateway endpoints^].

Supported ONTAP versions::
Minimum of ONTAP 9.8; ONTAP 9.8P13 and later is recommended.

Required information for using customer-managed keys for data encryption::

You can choose your own customer-managed keys for data encryption in the activation wizard instead of using the default Amazon S3 encryption keys. In this case you'll need to have the encryption managed keys already set up. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storage-management-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-setting-up-kms.html[See how to use your own keys^].

== Verify license requirements

For NetApp Backup and Recovery PAYGO licensing, a Console subscription is available in the AWS Marketplace that enables deployments of Cloud Volumes ONTAP and NetApp Backup and Recovery. You need to https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-oorxakq6lq7m4?sr=0-8&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa[subscribe to this NetApp Console subscription^] before you enable NetApp Backup and Recovery. Billing for NetApp Backup and Recovery is done through this subscription.

For an annual contract that enables you to back up both Cloud Volumes ONTAP data and on-premises ONTAP data, you need to subscribe from the https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-q7dg6zwszplri[AWS Marketplace page^] and then https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/task-adding-aws-accounts.html[associate the subscription with your AWS credentials^].

For an annual contract that enables you to bundle Cloud Volumes ONTAP and NetApp Backup and Recovery, you must set up the annual contract when you create a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. This option doesn't enable you to back up on-prem data.

For NetApp Backup and Recovery BYOL licensing, you need the serial number from NetApp that enables you to use the service for the duration and capacity of the license. link:br-start-licensing.html[Learn how to manage your BYOL licenses]. You must use a BYOL license when the Console agent and Cloud Volumes ONTAP system are deployed in a dark site.

And you need to have an AWS account for the storage space where your backups will be located.

== Prepare your Console agent

The Console agent must be installed in an AWS region with full or limited internet access ("standard" or "restricted" mode). https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/concept-modes.html[See NetApp Console deployment modes for details^].
//, or in a site with no internet access ("private" mode)

* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/concept-connectors.html[Learn about Console agents^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/task-quick-start-connector-aws.html[Deploy a Console agent in AWS in standard mode (full internet access)^]
* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/task-quick-start-restricted-mode.html[Install the Console agent in restricted mode (limited outbound access)^]
//* https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/task-quick-start-private-mode.html[Install the Console agent in private mode (no internet access)^]
//
//[NOTE]
//====
//NetApp Backup and Recovery functionality is built into the Console agent. When installed in private mode, you'll need to update the Console agent software periodically to get access to new features. Check the link:whats-new.html[NetApp Backup and Recovery What's new] to see the new features in each NetApp Backup and Recovery release, and then you can follow the steps to https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/task-upgrade-connector.html[upgrade the Console agent software^] when you want to use new features.
//
//We highly recommend that you create local backups of the internal NetApp Backup and Recovery configuration data periodically when the Console agent is installed in a site without internet connectivity. link:reference-backup-cbs-db-in-dark-site.html[See how to back up NetApp Backup and Recovery data in a dark site^].
//====

=== Verify or add permissions to the Console agent

The IAM role that provides the Console with permissions must include S3 permissions from the latest https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/reference-permissions-aws.html[Console policy^]. If the policy does not contain all of these permissions, see the https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies_manage-edit.html[AWS Documentation: Editing IAM policies^].

Here are the specific permissions from the policy:

[%collapsible]
====
[source,json]

                "glue:BatchCreatePartition",
                "glue:BatchDeletePartition"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::netapp-backup-*"
            ]
        },
====

NOTE: When creating backups in AWS China regions, you need to change the AWS Resource Name "arn" under all _Resource_ sections in the IAM policies from "aws" to "aws-cn"; for example `arn:aws-cn:s3:::netapp-backup-*`.

Required AWS Cloud Volumes ONTAP permissions::
When your Cloud Volumes ONTAP system is running ONTAP 9.12.1 or greater software, the IAM role that provides that system with permissions must include a new set of S3 permissions specifically for NetApp Backup and Recovery from the latest https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storage-management-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-set-up-iam-roles.html[Cloud Volumes ONTAP policy^].
+
If you created the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system using Console version 3.9.23 or greater, these permissions should be part of the IAM role already. Otherwise you'll need to add the missing permissions. 

Supported AWS regions::
NetApp Backup and Recovery is supported in all AWS regions, including AWS GovCloud regions. 
//It is also supported in https://aws.amazon.com/federal/us-intelligence-community/[AWS C2S and SC2S secure regions^].

Required setup for creating backups in a different AWS account::
By default, backups are created using the same account as the one used for your Cloud Volumes ONTAP system. If you want to use a different AWS account for your backups, you must:
* Verify that the permissions "s3:PutBucketPolicy" and "s3:PutBucketOwnershipControls" are part of the IAM role that provides the Console agent with permissions.
* Add the destination AWS account credentials in the Console. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/task-adding-aws-accounts.html#add-additional-credentials-to-a-connector[See how to do this^].
* Add the following permissions in the user credentials in the second account:
+
 "athena:StartQueryExecution",
 "athena:GetQueryResults",
 "athena:GetQueryExecution",
 "glue:GetDatabase",
 "glue:GetTable",
 "glue:CreateTable",
 "glue:CreateDatabase",
 "glue:GetPartitions",
 "glue:BatchCreatePartition",
 "glue:BatchDeletePartition"

Create your own buckets::
By default, the service creates buckets for you. If you want to use your own buckets, you can create them before you start the backup activation wizard and then select those buckets in the wizard. 
+
link:prev-ontap-protect-journey.html[Learn more about creating your own buckets^].  

==  Verify ONTAP networking requirements for replicating volumes

//This section uses an Include for all providers. It includes "Cloud Volumes ONTAP networking requirements", and "On-premises ONTAP networking requirements"   

include::../_include/backup-onprem-prepare-source-destination-systems-for-repl.adoc[]

//The following statement applies only to backup from CVO topics: 
* To replicate data between two Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems in different subnets, the subnets must be routed together (this is the default setting).

== Enable NetApp Backup and Recovery on Cloud Volumes ONTAP

Enabling NetApp Backup and Recovery is easy. The steps differ slightly depending on whether you have an existing Cloud Volumes ONTAP system or a new one. 

*Enable NetApp Backup and Recovery on a new system*

NetApp Backup and Recovery is enabled by default in the system wizard. Be sure to keep the option enabled.

See https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storage-management-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-deploying-otc-aws.html[Launching Cloud Volumes ONTAP in AWS^] for requirements and details for creating your Cloud Volumes ONTAP system.

.Steps

. From the Console *Systems* page, select *Add system*, choose the cloud provider, and select *Add New*. Select *Create Cloud Volumes ONTAP*.

. Select *Amazon Web Services* as the cloud provider and then choose a single node or HA system.

. Fill out the Details & Credentials page.

. On the Services page, leave the service enabled and select *Continue*.

. Complete the pages in the wizard to deploy the system.

.Result

NetApp Backup and Recovery is enabled on the system. After you've created volumes on these Cloud Volumes ONTAP systems, launch NetApp Backup and Recovery and link:prev-ontap-backup-manage.html[activate backup on each volume that you want to protect].
//NetApp Backup and Recovery is enabled on the system and backs up volumes every day and retains the most recent 30 backup copies.

*Enable NetApp Backup and Recovery on an existing system*

Enable NetApp Backup and Recovery on an existing system at any time directly from the Console.

.Steps

. From the Console *Systems* page, select the cluster and select *Enable* next to Backup and Recovery in the right-panel.
+
If the Amazon S3 destination for your backups exists as a cluster on the *Systems* page, you can drag the cluster onto the Amazon S3 system to initiate the setup wizard.


== Activate backups on your ONTAP volumes 

Activate backups at any time directly from your on-premises system.

A wizard takes you through the following major steps: 

* <<Select the volumes that you want to back up>>
* <<Define the backup strategy>>
* <<Review your selections>> 

You can also <<Show the API commands>> at the review step, so you can copy the code to automate backup activation for future systems.  

=== Start the wizard 

.Steps 

. Access the Activate backup and recovery wizard using one of the following ways: 
* From the Console *Systems* page, select the system and select *Enable > Backup Volumes* next to Backup and Recovery in the right-panel.
+
If the AWS destination for your backups exists as a system on the Console *Systems* page, you can drag the ONTAP cluster onto the AWS object storage.  
* Select *Volumes* in the Backup and Recovery bar. From the Volumes tab, select the *Actions* image:icon-action.png["Actions icon"] icon option and select *Activate Backup* for a single volume (that does not already have replication or backup to object storage already enabled).  

+ 
The Introduction page of the wizard shows the protection options including local Snapshots, replication, and backups. If you did the second option in this step, the Define Backup Strategy page appears with one volume selected. 

. Continue with the following options: 

* If you already have a Console agent, you're all set. Just select *Next*. 
* If you don't already have a Console agent, the *Add a Console agent* option appears. Refer to <<Prepare your Console agent>>. 

=== Select the volumes that you want to back up

Choose the volumes you want to protect. A protected volume is one that has one or more of the following: Snapshot policy, replication policy, backup to object policy. 

You can choose to protect FlexVol or FlexGroup volumes; however, you cannot select a mix of these volumes when activating backup for a system. See how to link:prev-ontap-backup-manage.html[activate backup for additional volumes in the system] (FlexVol or FlexGroup) after you have configured backup for the initial volumes.

[NOTE] 
====
* You can activate a backup only on a single FlexGroup volume at a time. 
* The volumes you select must have the same SnapLock setting. All volumes must have SnapLock Enterprise enabled or have SnapLock disabled. 
//(Volumes with SnapLock Compliance mode require ONTAP 9.14 or later.)
====

.Steps 

If the volumes you choose already have snapshot or replication policies applied, then the policies you select later will overwrite these existing policies. 

. In the Select Volumes page, select the volume or volumes you want to protect. 
+
* Optionally, filter the rows to show only volumes with certain volume types, styles, and more to make the selection easier. 
* After you select the first volume, then you can select all FlexVol volumes (FlexGroup volumes can be selected one at a time only). To back up all existing FlexVol volumes, check one volume first and then check the box in the title row. 
* To back up individual volumes, check the box for each volume.

. Select *Next*.

=== Define the backup strategy 

Defining the backup strategy involves setting the following options: 

* Whether you want one or all of the backup options: local Snapshots, replication, and backup to object storage
* Architecture
* Local snapshot policy
* Replication target and policy
+
NOTE: If the volumes you choose have different snapshot and replication policies than the policies you select in this step, the existing policies will be overwritten. 

* Backup to object storage information (provider, encryption, networking, backup policy, and export options). 

.Steps 

. In the Define backup strategy page, choose one or all of the following. All three are selected by default: 
+
* *Local Snapshots*: If you are performing replication or back up to object storage, local snapshots must be created. 
* *Replication*: Creates replicated volumes on another ONTAP storage system.  
* *Backup*: Backs up volumes to object storage.  

. *Architecture*: If you chose replication and backup, choose one of the following flows of information: 
* *Cascading*: Information flows from the primary storage system to the secondary, and from secondary to object storage. 
* *Fan out*: Information flows from the primary storage system to the secondary _and_ from the primary to object storage. 
+ 
For details about these architectures, refer to link:prev-ontap-protect-journey.html[Plan your protection journey]. 
 
. *Local Snapshot*: Choose an existing snapshot policy or create a new one. 
+
TIP: To create a custom policy before activating the snapshot, refer to link:br-use-policies-create.html[Create a policy].
+
To create a policy, select *Create new policy* and do the following: 
+
** Enter the name of the policy. 
** Select up to five schedules, typically of different frequencies. 
** Select *Create*. 

. *Replication*: Set the following options: 
+
* *Replication target*: Select the destination system and SVM. Optionally, select the destination aggregate or aggregates and prefix or suffix that will be added to the replicated volume name. 
* *Replication policy*: Choose an existing replication policy or create one. 
+
TIP: To create a custom policy, refer to link:br-use-policies-create.html[Create a policy].
+
To create a policy, select *Create new policy* and do the following: 
+
** Enter the name of the policy. 
** Select up to five schedules, typically of different frequencies. 
** Select *Create*. 
. *Back up to Object*: If you selected *Backup*, set the following options: 
+
* *Provider*: Select *Amazon Web Services*. 
* *Provider settings*: Enter the provider details and region where the backups will be stored.

+
Enter the AWS Account used to store the backups. This can be a different account than where the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system resides.
+
If you want to use a different AWS account for your backups, you must add the destination AWS account credentials in the Console, and add the permissions "s3:PutBucketPolicy" and "s3:PutBucketOwnershipControls" to the IAM role that provides the Console with permissions.

+
Select the region where the backups will be stored. This can be a different region than where the Cloud Volumes ONTAP system resides.

+ 
Either create a new bucket or select an existing one. 

* *Encryption key*: If you created a new bucket, enter encryption key information given to you from the provider. Choose whether you'll use the default AWS encryption keys, or choose your own customer-managed keys from your AWS account, to manage encryption of your data. (https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storage-management-cloud-volumes-ontap/task-setting-up-kms.html[See how to use your own encryption keys^]).

+ 
If you choose to use your own customer-managed keys, enter the key vault and key information. 

+ 
NOTE: If you chose an existing bucket, encryption information is already available, so you don't need to enter it now. 

* *Backup policy*: Select an existing backup-to-object storage policy or create one. 
+
TIP: To create a custom policy before activating the backup, refer to link:br-use-policies-create.html[Create a policy].
+
To create a policy, select *Create new policy* and do the following: 
+
** Enter the name of the policy. 
** Select up to five schedules, typically of different frequencies. 
** For backup-to-object policies, set the DataLock and Ransomware Resilience settings. For details on DataLock and Ransomware Resilience, refer to link:prev-ontap-policy-object-options.html[Backup-to-object policy settings].
// In backup to object only (not snapshots and replication) for CVO to AWS, CVO to Azure, onprem to AWS, Azure, S3, and SG - can do Advanced Settings for ransomware scans and datalock. Adv Settings does not apply to Google.)
** Select *Create*. 
* *Export existing Snapshot copies to object storage as backup copies*: If there are any local Snapshot copies for volumes in this system that match the backup schedule label you just selected for this system (for example, daily, weekly, etc.), this additional prompt is displayed. Check this box to have all historic Snapshots copied to object storage as backup files to ensure the most complete protection for your volumes.

. Select *Next*. 

//.. Enter the name for the default policy. You don't need to change the name.


//.. Optionally, when using ONTAP 9.11.1 and greater, you can choose to protect your backups from deletion and ransomware attacks by configuring one of the _DataLock and Ransomware Resilience_ settings. _DataLock_ protects your backup files from being modified or deleted, and _Ransomware protection_ scans your backup files to look for evidence of a ransomware attack in your backup files. link:concept-cloud-backup-policies.html#datalock-and-ransomware-protection[Learn more about the available DataLock settings^].
//+
//NOTE: If you plan to use DataLock, you must enable it in your first policy when activating NetApp Backup and Recovery. You might want to protect your backups from deletion by using _DataLock_.

//.. Optionally, when using ONTAP 9.10.1 and greater, you can choose to tier backups to either S3 Glacier or S3 Glacier Deep Archive storage after a certain number of days for further cost optimization. link:reference-aws-backup-tiers.html[Learn more about using archival tiers^].

=== Review your selections 

This is the chance to review your selections and make adjustments, if necessary. 

.Steps 

. In the Review page, review your selections. 
. Optionally check the box to *Automatically synchronize the Snapshot policy labels with the replication and backup policy labels*. This creates snapshots with a label that matches the labels in the replication and backup policies.  
. Select *Activate Backup*. 

.Result 

NetApp Backup and Recovery starts taking the initial backups of your volumes. The baseline transfer of the replicated volume and the backup file includes a full copy of the primary storage system data. Subsequent transfers contain differential copies of the primary storage system data contained in Snapshot copies.

A replicated volume is created in the destination cluster that will be synchronized with the primary storage volume. 

An S3 bucket is created in the service account indicated by the S3 access key and secret key you entered, and the backup files are stored there. 

The Volume Backup Dashboard is displayed so you can monitor the state of the backups. 

You can also monitor the status of backup and restore jobs using the link:br-use-monitor-tasks.html[Job Monitoring page].

=== Show the API commands 

You might want to display and optionally copy the API commands used in the Activate backup and recovery wizard. You might want to do this to automate backup activation in future systems. 

.Steps 

. From the Activate backup and recovery wizard, select *View API request*. 
. To copy the commands to the clipboard, select the *Copy* icon.
