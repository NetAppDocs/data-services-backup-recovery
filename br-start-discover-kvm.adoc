NetApp Backup and Recovery needs to discover KVM hosts and virtual machines before protecting them. 

*Required Console role*
Backup and Recovery super admin. Learn about link:reference-roles.html[Backup and recovery roles and privileges]. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about NetApp Console access roles for all services^].

== Add a KVM host and discover resources

Add KVM host information and let NetApp Backup and Recovery discover workloads. Within each Console agent, select the systems where you want to discover workloads.  

.Steps

. From the NetApp Console menu, select *Protection > Backup and Recovery*.
. In the KVM tile, select *Discover and manage*.
+
If this is your first time logging in to Backup and Recovery, you already have a system in the Console, but haven't discovered any resources, the "Welcome to the new NetApp Backup and Recovery" landing page appears and shows an option to *Discover resources*. 

. Select *Discover resources*.

. Enter the following information: 
.. *Workload type*: Select *KVM*.
.. If you haven't yet stored credentials for this KVM host, select *Add credentials*.
... Select the Console agent to use with this host.
... Enter a name for this credential.
... Choose whether to use root credentials or non-root credentials.
... Enter the user name and password for the account.
... Select *Done*.
.. *Host registration*: Add a new KVM host. Enter the host's FQDN or IP address, credentials, Console agent, and port number.
. Select *Discover*. 
+
TIP: This process might take a few minutes.

.Result
The KVM workload is displayed in the list of workloads on the Inventory page.

== Continue to the NetApp Backup and Recovery Dashboard

.Steps

. From the NetApp Console menu, select *Protection* > *Backup and recovery*.
. Select a workload tile (for example, Microsoft SQL Server).
. From the Backup and Recovery menu, select *Dashboard*.
. Review the health of data protection. The number of at risk or protected workloads increases based on the newly discovered, protected, and backed up workloads.
