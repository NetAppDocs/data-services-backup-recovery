Back up your Microsoft SQL Server application data from on-premises ONTAP systems to AWS, Azure, or StorageGRID using NetApp Backup and Recovery. The system automatically creates and stores backups in your cloud account, following your policies. Use a 3-2-1 strategy: keep three copies of your data on two storage systems and one copy in the cloud.

The benefits of the 3-2-1 approach include:

* Multiple data copies protect against internal and external cybersecurity threats.
* Using different types of media helps you recover if one type fails.
* You can quickly restore from the onsite copy, and use the offsite copies if the onsite copy is compromised.

NetApp Backup and Recovery uses NetApp SnapMirror to synchronize backups by creating snapshot copies and and transferring them tothe backup locations.

You can do the following to protect your data:

* link:br-use-manage-snapshots.html[Manage snapshots]

To back up workloads, you create policies that manage backup and restore operations. See link:br-use-policies-create.html[Create policies] for more information.

.Supported restore destinations

You can restore Microsoft SQL Server instances and databases from a backup that resides in primary storage or a secondary system (a replicated volume) or in object storage (a backup file) to the following systems. Snapshot copies reside on the source system and can be restored only to that same system.
