summary: You can back up Microsoft SQL Server applications data from on-premises ONTAP systems to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and StorageGRID, ensuring that your data is protected. Backups are automatically generated and stored in an object store in your public or private cloud account. You can implement a 3-2-1 strategy, where you have 3 copies of your source data on 2 different storage systems along with 1 copy in the cloud.

Protect your Microsoft SQL Server applications data from on-premises ONTAP systems to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or StorageGRID using NetApp Backup and Recovery. Backups are automatically generated and stored in an object store in your public or private cloud account based on the policies you create. You can implement a 3-2-1 strategy, where you have 3 copies of your source data on 2 different storage systems along with 1 copy in the cloud.

The benefits of the 3-2-1 approach include:

* Multiple data copies provide multi-layer protection against both internal (insider) and external cybersecurity threats.
* Multiple media types ensure failover viability in the case of physical or logical failure of one media type.
* The onsite copy facilitates quick restores, with the offsite copies available just in case the onsite copy is compromised.

NetApp Backup and Recovery leverages NetApp SnapMirror data replication technology to ensure that all the backups are fully synchronized by creating snapshot copies and transferring them to the backup locations.

You can accomplish the following protection goals:

To back up workloads, typically you create policies that govern the backup and restore operations. See link:br-use-policies-create.html[Create policies] for more information.



.Supported backup destinations

NetApp Backup and Recovery enables you to back up Microsoft SQL Server instances and databases from the following source systems to the following secondary systems and object storage in public and private cloud providers. Snapshot copies reside on the source system.

.Supported restore destinations

You can restore Microsoft SQL Server instances and databases from a backup that resides in primary storage or a secondary system (a replicated volume) or in object storage (a backup file) to the following systems. Snapshot copies reside on the source system and can be restored only to that same system.
