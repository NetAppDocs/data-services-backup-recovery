NetApp Backup and Recovery needs to first discover Microsoft SQL Server workloads in order for you to use the service. You can optionally import backup data and policies from SnapCenter if you already have SnapCenter installed. 

//* <<Discover Microsoft SQL Server workloads and optionally import SnapCenter resources>>
//* <<Discover Kubernetes workloads>>

*Required NetApp Console role*
Backup and Recovery super admin. Learn about link:reference-roles.html[Backup and recovery roles and privileges]. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about NetApp Console access roles for all services^].



== Discover Microsoft SQL Server workloads and optionally import SnapCenter resources

During discovery, NetApp Backup and Recovery analyzes Microsoft SQL Server instances and databases in systems within your organization. 

NetApp Backup and Recovery assesses Microsoft SQL Server applications. The service assesses the existing protection level including the current backup protection policies, snapshot copies, and backup and recovery options.

Discovery occurs in the following ways: 

* If you already have SnapCenter, import SnapCenter resources into NetApp Backup and Recovery by using the NetApp Backup and Recovery UI.
+
NOTE: If you already have SnapCenter, first check to be sure you've met the prerequisites before importing from SnapCenter. For example, you should add on-premises SnapCenter cluster storage systems to the NetApp Console first before importing from SnapCenter. See link:concept-start-prereq-snapcenter-import.html[Prerequisites for importing resources from SnapCenter].
+
* If you don't already have SnapCenter, you can still discover workloads by adding a vCenter manually and performing discovery.

=== If SnapCenter is already installed, import SnapCenter resources into NetApp Backup and Recovery

If you already have SnapCenter installed, import SnapCenter resources into NetApp Backup and Recovery using these steps. NetApp Console discovers resources, hosts, credentials, and schedules from SnapCenter; you don't have to recreate all that information. 

You can do this in the following ways: 

* During discovery, select an option to import resources from SnapCenter.
* After discovery, from the Inventory page, select an option to import SnapCenter resources.
* After discovery, from the Settings menu, select an option to import SnapCenter resources. For details, see link:br-start-configure.html[Configure NetApp Backup and Recovery].

This is a two-part process:

* Import SnapCenter Server application and host resources
* Manage selected SnapCenter host resources

==== Import SnapCenter Server application and host resources

This first step imports host resources from SnapCenter and displays those resources in the NetApp Backup and Recovery Inventory page. At that point, the resources are not yet managed by NetApp Backup and Recovery.

TIP: After you import SnapCenter host resources, NetApp Backup and Recovery does not take over protection management automatically. To do so, you must explicitly select to manage the imported resources in NetApp Backup and Recovery. This ensures that you are ready to have those resources backed up by NetApp Backup and Recovery. 

.Steps 

. From the NetApp Console left navigation, select *Protection* > *Backup and Recovery*. 
. Select *Inventory*.
+

.. *SnapCenter FQDN or IP address*: Enter the FQDN or IP address of the SnapCenter application itself.
.. *Port*: Enter the port number for the SnapCenter Server.
.. *Username* and *Password*: Enter the username and password for the SnapCenter Server.
.. *Console agent*: Select the Console agent for SnapCenter.


. Enter *SnapCenter server host credentials*:
.. *Existing credentials*: If you select this option, you can use the existing credentials that you have already added. Choose the credentials name. 
.. *Add new credentials*: If you don't have existing SnapCenter host credentials, you can add new credentials. Enter the credentials name, authentication mode, user name, and password.

. Select *Import* to validate your entries and register the SnapCenter Server.
+
NOTE: If the SnapCenter Server is already registered, you can  update the existing registration details.

.Result
The Inventory page shows the imported SnapCenter resources that include MS SQL hosts, instances, and databases.

image:../media/screen-br-inventory-details.png[Inventory page showing the imported SnapCenter resources and the details]

==== Manage SnapCenter host resources

After you import the SnapCenter resources, manage those host resources in NetApp Backup and Recovery. After you select to manage those resources, NetApp Backup and Recovery is able to back up and recover the resources that you imported from SnapCenter. You no longer manage those resources in SnapCenter Server. 

.Steps 
. After you import the SnapCenter resources, from the Backup and Recovery menu, select *Inventory*. 
. From the Inventory page, select the imported SnapCenter host that you want to have NetApp Backup and Recovery to manage from now on.  
+
image:../media/screen-br-inventory.png[Inventory page showing the imported SnapCenter resources]

. Select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *View details* to display the workload details.  
+
image:../media/screen-br-inventory-manage-option.png[Inventory page showing the imported SnapCenter resources and the Manage option]

. From the Inventory > workload page, select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *Manage* to display the Manage host page.   
//+
//image:../media/screen-br-inventory-manage-host.png[Inventory page showing the imported SnapCenter resources and the Manage option]

. Select *Manage*. 

. In the Manage host page, select either to use an existing vCenter or add a new vCenter. 


. Select *Manage*.
+
The Inventory page shows the newly managed SnapCenter resources.

You can optionally create a report of the managed resources by selecting the *Generate reports* option from the Actions menu.

==== Import SnapCenter resources after discovery from the Inventory page

If you have already discovered resources, you can import SnapCenter resources from the Inventory page.

.Steps
. From the Console left navigation, select *Protection* > *Backup and Recovery*.
. Select *Inventory*.
+
image:../media/screen-br-inventory.png[Inventory page]

. From the Inventory page, select *Import SnapCenter resources*.
. Follow the steps in the *Import SnapCenter resources* section above to import SnapCenter resources.


=== If you don't have SnapCenter installed, add a vCenter and discover resources

If you don't already have SnapCenter installed, you can add vCenter information and have NetApp backup and recovery discover workloads. Within each Console agent, select the systems where you want to discover workloads. 

This is optional if you have a VMware environment. 

.Steps

. From the Console left navigation, select *Protection* > *Backup and Recovery*. 
+
If this is your first time logging in to this service, you already have a system in the Console, but haven't discovered any resources, the "Welcome to the new NetApp Backup and Recovery" landing page appears and shows an option to *Discover resources*. 
+
image:screen-br-landing-discover-import-buttons.png[Landing page screenshot for NetApp Backup and Recovery without discovered resources]

. Select *Discover resources*.
+
image:screen-br-discover-workloads.png[Discover workload resources screenshot]

. Enter the following information: 
.. *Workload type*: For this version, only Microsoft SQL Server is available.   
.. *vCenter settings*: Select an existing vCenter or add a new one. To add a new vCenter, enter the vCenter FQDN or IP address, user name, password, port, and protocol.
+
TIP: If you are entering vCenter information, enter information for both vCenter settings and Host registration. If you added or entered vCenter information here, you also need to add plugin information in Advanced Settings next. 
.. *Host registration*:  Select *Add credentials* and enter information about the hosts containing the workloads you want to discover.
+
TIP: If you are adding a standalone server and not a vCenter server, enter only the host information.  


. Select *Discover*. 
+
TIP: This process might take a few minutes.

. Continue with Advanced Settings. 


==== Set Advanced settings options during discovery and install the plugin

With Advanced Settings, you can manually install the plugin agent on all servers being registered. This enables you to import all SnapCenter workloads into NetApp Backup and Recovery so you can manage backups and restores there. NetApp Backup and Recovery shows the steps needed to install the plugin. 

//If you entered vCenter information during discovery, you need to add plugin information in Advanced Settings.


.Steps

. From the Discover resources page, continue to Advanced Settings by clicking the down arrow on the right. 
+

. In the Discover workload resources page, enter the following information. 
* *Enter plug-in port number*: Enter the port number that the plugin uses.
* *Installation path*: Enter the path where the plugin will be installed. 

. If you want to install the SnapCenter agent manually, check the boxes for the following options:
* *Use manual installation*: Check this box to install the  plugin manually.   
//* *Use Group Managed Service Account (gMSA)*: If you use a specific third-party gMSA account to manage host credentials, check this box. 
* *Add all hosts in the cluster*: Check this box to add all hosts in the cluster to NetApp Backup and Recovery during discovery.
* *Skip optional preinstall checks*: Check this box to skip optional preinstall checks. You might want to do this for example, if you know that memory or space considerations will be changed in the near future and you want to install the plugin now.
//* *Skip automated installation*: Check this box to skip the automated installation of the plugin. You might want to do this if you are installing the plugin manually.

. Select *Discover*.



//. To enable the ability to add tags to your resources for easier management, check *Add tag option for resources*. (This feature is not available for the Preview 2025 version.)    
 
==== Continue to the NetApp Backup and Recovery Dashboard


. To display the NetApp Backup and Recovery Dashboard, from the Backup and Recovery menu, select *Dashboard*.   

. Review the health of data protection. The number of at risk or protected workloads increases based on the newly discovered, protected, and backed up workloads.

//== Discover Kubernetes workloads
//In the backup and recovery inventory, you can discover Kubernetes workloads that are running in your environment. Discovering a workload adds a Kubernetes cluster to NetApp Backup and Recovery, enabling you to then add applications to the cluster and protect the resources hosted by the cluster.

//.Steps
//. Do one of the following:

//* If you are discovering Kubernetes workloads for the first time, in NetApp Backup and Recovery, select *Discover and Manage* under the Kubernetes workload type.
//* If you have already discovered Kubernetes workloads, in NetApp Backup and Recovery, select *Inventory* > *Workloads* and then select *Discover resources*.

//. Select the *Kubernetes* workload type.
//. Enter a cluster name and choose a connector to use with the cluster.
//. Follow the command line instructions that appear:
//+
//* Create a Trident protect namespace
//* Create a Kubernetes secret
//* Add a Helm repository
//* Install Trident protect and the Trident protect connector
//+
//These steps ensure that NetApp Backup and Recovery can interact with the cluster.
//. After you complete the steps, select *Discover*.
//+
//The cluster is added to the inventory.
//. Select *View* in the associated Kubernetes workload to see the list of applications, clusters, and namespaces for that workload.
