The SnapMirror to Cloud Resync feature in NetApp Backup and Recovery streamlines data protection and continuity during volume migrations in NetApp environments. When a volume is migrated using SnapMirror Logical Replication (LRSE), from one on-premises NetApp deployment to another, or to a cloud-based solution such as Cloud Volumes ONTAP or Cloud Volumes Service, SnapMirror to Cloud Resync ensures that existing cloud backups remain intact and operational. 

This feature eliminates the need for a time-consuming and resource-intensive re-baseline operation, enabling backup operations to continue post-migration. This feature is valuable in workload migration scenarios, supporting both FlexVols and FlexGroups, and is available starting with ONTAP version 9.16.1. 

By maintaining backup continuity across environments, SnapMirror to Cloud Resync enhances operational efficiency and reduces the complexity of hybrid and multi-cloud data management. 


== How NetApp Backup and Recovery SnapMirror to Cloud Resync Works 

If you complete a technical refresh or migrate volumes from one ONTAP cluster to another, it's important that your backups continue to work without interruption. NetApp Backup and Recovery SnapMirror to Cloud Resync helps with this by ensuring that your cloud backups stay consistent even after a volume migration. 

Here's an example: 

Imagine you have an on-premises volume called Vol1a. This volume has three snapshots: S1, S2, and S3. These snapshots are like restore points. Vol1 is already being backed up to a cloud object store endpoint using SnapMirror to Cloud (SM-C). However, only S1 and S2 have been backed up to object store so far. 

Now, you want to migrate Vol1 to another ONTAP cluster. To do this, you create a SnapMirror Logical Replication (LRSE) relationship to a new cloud volume called Vol1b. This transfers all three snapshots—S1, S2, and S3—from Vol1a to Vol1b. 

After the migration is complete, you have the following setup: 

* The original SM-C relationship (Vol1a → Object store) is deleted. 

* The LRSE relationship (Vol1a → Vol1b) is also deleted. 

* Vol1b is now your active volume. 

At this point, you want to continue backing up Vol1b to the same cloud endpoint. But instead of starting a full backup from scratch (which would take time and resources), you use SnapMirror to Cloud Resync. 

Here's how the resync works: 

* The system checks for a common snapshot between Vol1a and Object store. In this case, both have S2. 

* Because of this shared snapshot, the system needs to transfer only the incremental changes between S2 and S3. 

This means only the new data added after S2 is sent to object store, not the entire volume. 

This process avoids re-sending data that's already backed up, saves bandwidth, and ensures that your backup chain continues smoothly after migration.

== Procedure notes

* The destination ONTAP cluster must be running ONTAP version 9.16.1 or later. 

* The old source ONTAP cluster must be protected using NetApp Backup and Recovery. 

* Migrations and tech refreshes are not performed using NetApp Backup and Recovery. They should be carried out by a professional services team or a qualified storage administrator. 

* A NetApp migration team is responsible for creating the SnapMirror relationship between the source and destination ONTAP clusters to facilitate volume migration. 

* Ensure that the migration during a tech refresh is based on SnapMirror-based migration. 

* SnapMirror to Cloud Resync after migrations using SVM-Migrate, SVM-DR, or Head Swap methods are not currently supported. 

== How to migrate volumes using SnapMirror to Cloud Resync

Migrating volumes using SnapMirror to Cloud Resync involves the following major steps, each described in more detail below: 


* *Follow a pre-migration checklist*: Before starting the migration, a NetApp Tech Refresh team ensures the following prerequisites are met to avoid data loss and ensure a smooth migration process.

* *Follow a post-migration checklist*: After the migration, a NetApp Tech Refresh team ensures the following steps are completed to establish protection and prepare for the resync. 

* *Perform a SnapMirror to Cloud Resync*: After the migration, a NetApp Tech Refresh team performs a SnapMirror to Cloud Resync operation to resume cloud backups from the newly migrated volumes.

=== Follow a pre-migration checklist

Before starting the migration, a NetApp Tech Refresh team ensures the following prerequisites are met to avoid data loss and ensure a smooth migration process.

. Ensure all volumes that are to be migrated are protected using NetApp Backup and Recovery.
. Record volume instance UUIDs. Write down the Instance UUIDs of all volumes before starting the migration. These identifiers are crucial for mapping and resync operations later. 
. Take a final snapshot of each volume to preserve the latest state, before deleting any SnapMirror relationships. 
. Document SnapMirror policies. Record the SnapMirror policy currently attached to each volume's relationship. This will be needed later during the SnapMirror to Cloud Resync process.
. Delete the SnapMirror Cloud relationships with the object store. 
. Create a standard SnapMirror relationship with the new ONTAP cluster to migrate the volume to the new target ONTAP cluster. 


=== Follow a post-migration checklist

After the migration, a NetApp Tech Refresh team ensures the following steps are completed to establish protection and prepare for the resync. 

. Record new volume instance UUIDs of all migrated volumes in the destination ONTAP cluster. 

. Confirm that all required SnapMirror policies that were available in the old ONTAP cluster are correctly configured in the new ONTAP cluster. 

. Add the new ONTAP cluster as a system in the Console *Systems* page. 



=== Perform a SnapMirror to Cloud Resync

After the migration, a NetApp Tech Refresh team performs a SnapMirror to Cloud Resync operation to resume cloud backups from the newly migrated volumes.




. Add the new ONTAP cluster as a system in the Console *Systems* page. 

. Look at the NetApp Backup and Recovery Volumes page to ensure that the old source system details are available. 

. From the NetApp Backup and Recovery Volumes page, select *Backup Settings*. 

. From the menu, select *Resync backup*. 

. In the Resync system page, do the following: 

.. *New source system*: Enter the new ONTAP cluster where the volumes have been migrated. 

.. *Existing Target Object Store*: Select the target object store that contains the backups from the old source system. 

. Select *Download CSV Template* to download the Resync Details Excel sheet. Use this sheet to enter the details of the volumes to be migrated. In the CSV file, enter the following details:
* The old volume instance UUID from the source cluster
* The new volume instance UUID from the destination cluster
* The SnapMirror policy to be applied to the new relationship. 


. Select *Upload* under the *Upload Volume Mapping Details* to upload the completed CSV sheet into the NetApp Backup and Recovery UI.  
 

. Enter provider and network configuration information required for the resync operation. 

. Select *Submit* to start the validation process. 

+
NetApp Backup and Recovery validates that each volume selected for resync has at least one common snapshot. This ensures that the volumes are ready for the SnapMirror to Cloud Resync operation.

. Review validation results including the new source volume names and the resync status for each volume. 

. Check volume eligibility. The system checks if the volumes are eligible for resync. If a volume is not eligible, it means that no common snapshot was found. 

+
IMPORTANT: To ensure that volumes remain eligible for the SnapMirror to Cloud Resync operation, take a final snapshot of each volume before deleting any SnapMirror relationships during the pre-migration phase. This preserves the latest state of the data. 

. Select *Resync* to start the resync operation. The system uses the common snapshot to transfer only the incremental changes, ensuring backup continuity.


. Monitor the resyn process in the Job Monitor page.
