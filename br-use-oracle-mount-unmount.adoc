You might want to mount an Oracle database recovery point if you need to access the database in a controlled state to perform recovery operations.

. Steps

. From the NetApp Console menu, select *Protection > Backup and Recovery*.
. Select the Oracle tile.
. In the Backup and Recovery menu, select *Inventory*.
. For the Oracle workload in the list, select *View*.
. Select the *Databases* menu.
. Choose a database from the list and select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *View protection details*.
+
A list of recovery points for that database appears.

. In the dialog that appears, do the following:
