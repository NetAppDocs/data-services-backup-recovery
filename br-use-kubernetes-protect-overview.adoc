Managing Kubernetes workloads in NetApp Backup and Recovery enables you to discover, manage, and protect your Kubernetes clusters and applications all in one place. You can manage resources and applications hosted on your Kubernetes clusters. You can also create and associate protection policies with your Kubernetes workloads, all using a single interface.

The following diagram shows the components and basic architecture of backup and recovery for Kubernetes workloads and how different copies of your data can be stored in different locations:

NetApp Backup and Recovery provides the following benefits for managing Kubernetes workloads:

* A single control plane for protecting applications running across multiple Kubernetes clusters. These applications can include containers or virtual machines running on your Kubernetes clusters.
* Native integration with NetApp SnapMirror, enabling storage offloading capabilities for all backup and recovery workflows. 
* Incremental forever backups for Kubernetes applications, translating to lower Recovery Point Objectives (RPOs) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTOs).

NOTE: This documentation is provided as a technology preview. During the preview, Kubernetes functionality is not recommended for production workloads. With this preview offering, NetApp reserves the right to modify offering details, contents, and timeline before General Availability.
