//For details about DataLock and tips on how to mitigate the associated costs, refer to link:concept-cloud-backup-policies.html[Backup-to-object policy settings].

=== AWS IAM Roles Anywhere integration 

The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Identity and access Roles Anywhere service enables you to use IAM roles and short-term credentials for your workloads _outside_ of AWS to access AWS APIs securely, the same way that you use IAM roles for workloads _on_ AWS. When you use IAM Roles Anywhere private key infrastructure and AWS tokens, you don't need long-term AWS access keys and secret keys. This enables you to rotate credentials more frequently, improving security.

With this release, support for AWS IAM Roles Anywhere service is a technology preview.
