=== Podman support on RHEL 8 or 9 with Browse and Restore
NetApp Backup and Recovery now supports file and folder restores on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) versions 8 and 9 using the Podman engine. This applies to the NetApp Backup and Recovery Browse and Restore method. 

Console agent version 3.9.40 supports certain versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions 8 and 9 for any manual installation of the Console agent software on a RHEL 8 or 9 host, regardless of the location in addition to the operating systems mentioned in the https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/task-prepare-private-mode.html#step-3-review-host-requirements[host requirements^]. These newer RHEL versions require the Podman engine instead of the Docker engine. Previously, NetApp Backup and Recovery had two limitations when using the Podman engine. These limitations have been removed.
