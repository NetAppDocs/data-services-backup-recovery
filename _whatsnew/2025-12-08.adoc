=== VMware workloads preview enhancements
The preview release of VMware workloads introduces the following enhanced capabilities:

* You can now restore backups and snapshots to an alternate location. This is useful if you want to manage versions of a VM on a different vCenter deployment, ESXi host, or datastore.
* You can now restore virtual disks (VMDKs) from either a primary or secondary location.
