=== Hyper-V workloads preview enhancements 

You can now restore Hyper-V VM backups and snapshots to an alternate location. This is useful if you want to manage versions of a VM on different Hyper-V hosts.

NOTE: In this release only, you cannot upgrade the NetApp plugins for Hyper-V or Windows using the *Upgrade* option in the Actions menu. Instead, remove each Hyper-V host and add it again to update the plugins.
