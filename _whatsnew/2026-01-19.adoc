=== Hyper-V workloads preview enhancements
This release of Hyper-V workloads introduces the following enhanced capabilities:

* You can now restore Hyper-V VM backups and snapshots to an alternate location. This is useful if you want to manage versions of a VM on different Hyper-V hosts.
* Hyper-V virtual machines provisioned by System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) and hosted on a CIFS share are now supported by NetApp Backup and Recovery.
* You can now edit protection groups.

NOTE: In this release only, you cannot upgrade the NetApp plugins for Hyper-V or Windows using the *Upgrade* option in the Actions menu. Instead, remove each Hyper-V host and add it again to update the plugins.
