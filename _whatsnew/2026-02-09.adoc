=== Kubernetes workloads enhancements
Kubernetes workload support is now generally available (GA) in NetApp Backup and Recovery. This release of Kubernetes workloads also introduces the following enhanced capabilities:

* CR workflow support for protection operations: You can now perform common protection tasks using CRs as well as the Backup and Recovery web UI.
* You can now add existing Kubernetes clusters protected with Trident Protect to Backup and Recovery.
* Alerting framework support: You now receive email and UI alerts for certain Kubernetes workload events.
* Restore tab integration: You can now access the Kubernetes workload restore actions from the Restore menu.
* Support for the 3-2-1 fanout backup architecture: You can now use a 3-2-1 fanout architecture in your protection policy when protecting Kubernetes workloads.

=== Oracle Database workloads enhancements
This release of Oracle Database workloads introduces the following enhanced capabilities:

* Non-root user support: Backup, recovery, and clone operations can be executed by non-root users, improving security and compliance.
* Backup, Recovery, and Clone for primary and secondary storage: Identical backup, recovery, and clone capabilities are now supported for primary and secondary (replicated) storage, enabling coordinated disaster recovery and backup workflows.
* Backup and Restore for object store: Native backup and restore capabilities for object-based storage targets (S3-compatible).
* Backup, Restore, and Clone for NAS, SAN, and ASM (ASM Lib v2): Unified backup, restore, and clone support across NAS, SAN, and ASM environments using ASM library v2.
* Clone Split: Ability to split writable snapshots (clones) from their parent volumes, freeing up storage and enabling independent operations.
* CLM from Primary and Secondary: Clone Lifecycle Management (CLM) operations on both primary and secondary systems for efficient data provisioning.
* Clone to Alternate Host from Primary and Secondary: Provision clones directly onto a different host (for testing or analytics) from both primary and secondary arrays.
* CG Supported: Consistency Group (CG) functionality is fully supported, ensuring application-consistent snapshots across multiple volumes.
* Backup and Recovery now supports the following protection policy architectures for Oracle workloads:
** 3-2-1 Fanout
** Disk-to-Disk (D2D)
** Disk-to-Object Storage
** Cascading
** Local Snapshot
