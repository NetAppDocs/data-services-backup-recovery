=== Kubernetes workloads enhancements
Kubernetes workload support is now generally available (GA) in NetApp Backup and Recovery. This release of Kubernetes workloads also introduces the following enhanced capabilities:

* *CR workflow support*: You can now perform common protection tasks using CRs as well as the Backup and Recovery web UI.
* *Cluster migration*: You can now add existing Kubernetes clusters protected with Trident Protect to Backup and Recovery.
* *Alerting framework support*: You now receive email and UI alerts for certain Kubernetes workload events.
* *Restore tab integration*: You can now access the Kubernetes workload restore actions from the Restore menu.
* *Support for the 3-2-1 fanout backup architecture*: You can now use a 3-2-1 fanout architecture in your protection policy when protecting Kubernetes workloads.

=== Oracle Database workloads enhancements
This release of Oracle Database workloads introduces the following enhanced capabilities:

* *Non-root user support*: Non-root users can now perform backup, restore, and clone operations, improving security and compliance.
* *Clone support*: Identical backup, restore, and clone capabilities are now supported across primary and secondary NAS, SAN, and ASM environments using ASM library v2, enabling coordinated protection workflows.
* *Clone split support*: You can now split writable snapshots (clones) from their parent volumes, freeing up storage and enabling independent operations.
* *Backup and restore for object store*: Native backup and restore capabilities are now supported for object-based storage targets (S3-compatible).
* *Clone Lifecycle Management (CLM)*: Clone refresh operations are supported on both primary and secondary storage for efficient data provisioning.
* *Clone to alternate host*: You can now clone databases directly to a different host (for testing or analytics) from both primary and secondary storage.
* *Consistency Group support*: Consistency Groups are now supported, ensuring application-consistent snapshots across multiple volumes.
* Backup and Recovery now supports the following protection policy architectures for Oracle workloads:
** 3-2-1 fanout
** Disk to disk
** Disk to object storage
** Cascading
** Local snapshot
