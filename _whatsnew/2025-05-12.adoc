=== SnapMirror to Cloud Resync for volume migrations

The SnapMirror to Cloud Resync feature streamlines data protection and continuity during volume migrations in NetApp environments. When a volume is migrated using SnapMirror Logical Replication (LRSE), from one on-premises NetApp deployment to another, or to a cloud-based solution such as Cloud Volumes ONTAP or Cloud Volumes Service, SnapMirror to Cloud Resync ensures that existing cloud backups remain intact and operational. 

This feature eliminates the need for a time-consuming and resource-intensive re-baseline operation, enabling backup operations to continue post-migration. This feature is valuable in workload migration scenarios, supporting both FlexVols and FlexGroups, and is available starting with ONTAP version 9.16.1. 

By maintaining backup continuity across environments, SnapMirror to Cloud Resync enhances operational efficiency and reduces the complexity of hybrid and multi-cloud data management. 



For details on how to perform the resync operation, see https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/data-services-backup-recovery/prev-ontap-migrate-resync.html[Migrate volumes using SnapMirror to Cloud Resync].


=== Support for third-party MinIO object store (Preview)

NetApp Backup and Recovery now extends its support to third-party object stores with a primary focus on MinIO. This new preview feature enables you to leverage any S3-compatible object store for your backup and recovery needs. 

With this preview version, we hope to ensure robust integration with third-party object stores before the full functionality is rolled out. You are encouraged to explore this new capability and provide feedback to help enhance the service. 

IMPORTANT: This feature should not be used in production.


*Preview mode limitations*

While this feature is in preview, there are certain limitations: 

* Bring Your Own Bucket (BYOB) is not supported. 
* Enabling DataLock in the policy is not supported. 
* Enabling Archival mode in the policy is not supported. 
* Only on-premises ONTAP environments are supported. 
* MetroCluster is not supported.
* Options to enable bucket-level encryption are not supported.

*Getting started* 

To begin using this preview feature, you must enable a  flag on the Console agent. You can then enter the connection details of you MinIO third-party object store in the protection workflow by choosing *Third party Compatible* object store in the backup section.
