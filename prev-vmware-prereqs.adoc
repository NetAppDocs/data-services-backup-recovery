Before you begin protecting your virtual machines workloads with NetApp Backup and Recovery, ensure that you meet the following prerequisites:


* SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere 4.6P1 or later
** You should be using SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere 4.7P1 or later to back up datastores from on-premises secondary storage.
* ONTAP 9.8 or later
* NetApp Console 
* NFS and VMFS datastores are supported. vVols are not supported.
* For VMFS support, the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere host should be running on 4.9 or later. Ensure to take a backup of the VMFS datastore if the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere host was upgraded from an earlier version to the 4.9 release.
* At least one backup should have been taken in SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere 4.6P1.
* At least one daily, weekly, or monthly policy in SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere with no label or same label as that of the Virtual Machines policy in the Console.
* For a pre-canned policy, the schedule tier should be the same for the datastore in SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere and in the cloud.
* Ensure that there are no FlexGroup volumes in the datastore because backing up and restoring FlexGroup volumes are not supported.
* Disable "*_recent*" on the required resource groups. If you have "*_recent*" enabled for the resource group, then the backups of those resource groups cannot be used for data protection to cloud and subsequently cannot be used for the restore operation.
* Ensure that the destination datastore where the virtual machine will be restored has enough space to accommodate a copy of all virtual machine files such as VMDK, VMX, VMSD, and so on.
* Ensure that the destination datastore does not have stale virtual machine files in the format of restore_xxx_xxxxxx_filename from the previous restore operation failures. You should delete the stale files before triggering a restore operation.
* To deploy a connector with proxy configured, ensure that all outgoing connector calls are routed through the proxy server.
* If a volume backing up a datastore is already protected from the Volumes tab (NetApp Backup and Recovery -> Volumes), then the same datastore cannot be protected again from the Virtual Machines tab (NetApp Backup and Recovery -> Virtual Machines).
