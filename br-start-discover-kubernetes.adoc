NetApp Backup and Recovery needs to first discover Kubernetes workloads in order for you to use the service. 

*Required NetApp Console role*
Backup and Recovery super admin. Learn about link:reference-roles.html[Backup and recovery roles and privileges]. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about NetApp Console access roles for all services^].


== Discover Kubernetes workloads
In the backup and recovery inventory, you can discover Kubernetes workloads that are running in your environment. Discovering a workload adds a Kubernetes cluster to NetApp Backup and Recovery, enabling you to then add applications to the cluster and protect the resources hosted by the cluster.

.Steps
. Do one of the following:

* If you are discovering Kubernetes workloads for the first time, in NetApp Backup and Recovery, select *Discover and Manage* under the Kubernetes workload type.
* If you have already discovered Kubernetes workloads, in NetApp Backup and Recovery, select *Inventory* > *Workloads* and then select *Discover resources*.

. Select the *Kubernetes* workload type.
. Enter a cluster name and choose a connector to use with the cluster.
. Follow the command line instructions that appear:
+
* Create a Trident protect namespace
* Create a Kubernetes secret
* Add a Helm repository
* Install Trident protect and the Trident protect connector
+
These steps ensure that NetApp Backup and Recovery can interact with the cluster.
. After you complete the steps, select *Discover*.
+
The cluster is added to the inventory.
. Select *View* in the associated Kubernetes workload to see the list of applications, clusters, and namespaces for that workload.

== Continue to the NetApp Backup and Recovery Dashboard
To display the NetApp Backup and Recovery Dashboard, follow these steps. 

. From the top menu, select *Dashboard*.   

. Review the health of data protection. The number of at risk or protected workloads increases based on the newly discovered, protected, and backed up workloads.
