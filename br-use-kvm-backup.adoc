Back up KVM protection groups from on-premises ONTAP systems to Amazon Web Services or StorageGRID to ensure that your data is protected. When you back up a protection group, the NetApp Console backs up the VMs and storage pools contained in the protection group. 
//Backups are automatically generated and stored in an object store in your public or private cloud account. 

NOTE: To back up protection groups on a schedule, create policies that govern the backup and restore operations. See link:br-use-policies-create.html[Create policies] for instructions.

//* Create protection groups to manage the backup and restore operations for a set of resources. See link:br-use-kvm-protection-groups.html[Create and manage protection groups for KVM workloads with NetApp Backup and Recovery] for more information.
//* Back up workloads now (create an on-demand backup now).

You can run an on-demand backup immediately. This is helpful if you're about to make changes to your system and want to ensure that you have a backup before you start.
