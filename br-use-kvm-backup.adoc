Back up KVM protection groups from on-premises ONTAP systems to Amazon Web Services, Azure NetApp Files, or StorageGRID to ensure that your data is protected. When you back up a protection group, the NetApp Console backs up the VMs and storage pools contained in the protection group. Backups are automatically generated and stored in an object store in your public or private cloud account. 

NOTE: To back up protection groups on a schedule, create policies that govern the backup and restore operations. See link:br-use-policies-create.html[Create policies] for instructions.

* Create protection groups to manage the backup and restore operations for a set of resources. See link:br-use-kvm-protection-groups.html[Create and manage protection groups for KVM workloads with NetApp Backup and Recovery] for more information.
//* Back up workloads now (create an on-demand backup now).
