Restore VMware workloads from snapshots, from a workload backup replicated to secondary storage, or from backups stored in object storage using NetApp Backup and Recovery.

//You can restore a workload to the original working environment, to a different working environment that's using the same cloud account, or to an on-premises ONTAP system. 

//different types of restore operations, volume restore or file/folder restore, Browse and restore vs Search and restore)

.Restore from these locations

You can restore workloads from different starting locations: 

* Restore from a primary location (local snapshot)
* Restore from a replicated resource on secondary storage
* Restore from an object storage backup

.Restore to these points   

You can restore data to these points: 

* *Restore to the original location*: The VM is restored in the original location, to the same vCenter deployment, ESXi host, and datastore. The VM and all of its data is overwritten.
* *Restore to an alternate location*: You can choose a different vCenter, ESXi host, or datastore as a restore target for the VM. This is useful for managing different copies of the same VM in different locations and states.

.Restore from object storage considerations

If Ransomware Resilience is enabled for a backup file in object storage, you are asked to run an extra check before restoring. We recommend performing the scan.

TIP: You might pay extra fees to your cloud provider to access the backup file.

== How restoring workloads works

When you restore workloads, the following occurs: 

* When you restore a workload from a local backup file, NetApp Backup and Recovery creates a _new_ resource using the data from the backup. 

* When you restore from a replicated workload, you can restore the workload to the original system or to an on-premises ONTAP system.

* When you restore a backup from object storage, you can restore the data to the original system or to an on-premises ONTAP system.


//== Restore methods

//You can restore workloads using one of the following methods. Typically, choose a method based on your restore needs:

From the Restore page (Search & Restore), you can restore a resource by searching for the snapshot with filters, even if you do not remember its exact name, location, or last known date.

//* *From the Inventory page (also known as Browse & Restore)*: Use this when you need to restore a specific resource from the last week or month -- and you know the name and location of the resource, and the date when it was last in good shape. You browse through a list of resources to find the one you want to restore.

//Inventory is browse and restore. Restore page is Search and restore. 


== Restore workload data from the Restore option (Search & Restore)

Restore VMware workloads using the Restore option. You can search for the snapshot by its name or by using filters. 

*Required NetApp Console role*
Storage viewer, Backup and Recovery super admin, Backup and Recovery restore admin role. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about NetApp Console access roles for all services^].

.Steps

. From the NetApp Backup and Recovery menu, select *Restore*.
. From the drop-down list to the right of the name search field, select *VMware*. 
. Enter the name of the resource you want to restore or filter for the vCenter, datacenter, or datastore where the resource that you want to restore is located. 
+
A list of virtual machines appears that match your search criteria.

. Find the VM that you want to restore from in the list, and select the *Restore virtual machine* button for that VM. 
+
A list of snapshots (restore points) created on that virtual machine appears.
. Enable the check box for the snapshot you want to restore.
. Select *Next*.
+
Snapshot location options appear.

. Select the restore destination for the snapshot:  
+
* *Local*: Restores the snapshot from the local location.
* *Secondary*: Restores the snapshot from a remote storage location. 
+
If you choose secondary storage, enter the source and destination locations for both data and logs. 
  
. Select *Next* to continue to the Restore destination settings page.
. Choose the destination settings and pre- and post-restore options.

.Restore to original location

--

When restoring to the original location, you cannot change the destination vCenter, ESXi host, datastore, or name of the VM. The original VM is overwritten with the restore operation.

.. Select the *Original location* pane.
.. Choose from the following options:
+
* *Pre-restore options* section:
** *Prescript*: Enable this option to automate additional tasks by running a custom script before the restore operation begins. Enter the full path for the script that should be run and any arguments that the script takes.
* *Post-restore options* section:
** *Restart virtual machine*: Enable this option to restart the virtual machine after the restore operation completes and after the post-restore script is applied.
** *Postscript*: Enable this option to automate additional tasks by running a custom script after the restore is complete. Enter the full path for the script that should be run and any arguments that the script takes.

.. Select *Restore*.

--

.Restore to alternate location

--

When restoring to an alternate location, you can change the destination vCenter, ESXi host, datastore, and name of the VM to create a new copy of the VM in a different location or with a different name.

.. Select the *Alternate location* pane.
.. Enter the following information:
+
* *Destination settings* section:
** *vCenter FQDN or IP address*: Select the vCenter server where you want to restore the snapshot.
** *ESXi host*: Select the host where you want to restore the snapshot.
** *Network*: Select the network where you want to restore the snapshot.
** *Datastore*: Enter the name of the datastore where you want to restore the snapshot.
** *Virtual machine name*: Enter the name of the VM where you want to restore the snapshot. If the name matches a VM that already exists in the datastore, Backup and Recovery makes the name unique by appending a current timestamp.
* *Pre-restore options* section:
** *Prescript*: Enable this option to automate additional tasks by running a custom script before the restore operation begins. Enter the full path for the script that should be run and any arguments that the script takes.
* *Post-restore options* section:
** *Restart virtual machine*: Enable this option to restart the virtual machine after the restore operation completes and after the post-restore script is applied.
** *Postscript*: Enable this option to automate additional tasks by running a custom script after the restore is complete. Enter the full path for the script that should be run and any arguments that the script takes.

.. Select *Restore*.

//== Restore workloads from cloud storage 

//When you restore workloads from cloud providers, you might be prompted for additional information. 

//[TO BR TEAM: Is this the correct information?]   


//ifdef::aws[]
//* When restoring from Amazon S3, select the IPspace in the ONTAP cluster where the destination volume will reside, enter the access key and secret key for the user you created to give the ONTAP cluster access to the S3 bucket, and optionally choose a private VPC endpoint for secure data transfer.
//endif::aws[]
//ifdef::azure[]
//* When restoring from Azure Blob, select the IPspace in the ONTAP cluster where the destination volume will reside, select the Azure Subscription to access the object storage, and optionally choose a private endpoint for secure data transfer by selecting the VNet and Subnet.
//endif::azure[]
//ifdef::gcp[]
//* When restoring from Google Cloud Storage, select the Google Cloud Project and the Access Key and Secret Key to access the object storage, the region where the backups are stored, and the IPspace in the ONTAP cluster where the destination volume will reside.
//endif::gcp[]
//* When restoring from StorageGRID, enter the FQDN of the StorageGRID server and the port that ONTAP should use for HTTPS communication with StorageGRID, select the Access Key and Secret Key needed to access the object storage, and the IPspace in the ONTAP cluster where the destination volume will reside.
//* When restoring from ONTAP S3, enter the FQDN of the ONTAP S3 server and the port that ONTAP should use for HTTPS communication with ONTAP S3, select the Access Key and Secret Key needed to access the object storage, and the IPspace in the ONTAP cluster where the destination volume will reside.


//* When restoring a backup from object storage to a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system using ONTAP 9.13.0 or greater or to an on-premises ONTAP system running ONTAP 9.14.1, you'll have the option to perform a _quick restore_ operation.

//* And if you are restoring the volume from a backup file that resides in an archival storage tier (available starting with ONTAP 9.10.1), then you can select the Restore Priority.

//.Steps
//. Click *Next* to choose whether you want to do a Normal restore or a Quick Restore process: 
//+
//image:screenshot_restore_browse_quick_restore.png[A screenshot showing the normal and Quick restore processes.]
//+
//* *Normal restore*: Use normal restore on volumes that require high performance. Volumes will not be available until the restore process is complete. 
//* *Quick restore*: You can use the restored volumes and data immediately. Do not use this on volumes that require high performance because during the quick restore process, access to the data might be slower than usual. 


//. Click *Restore* and you are returned to the Restore Dashboard so you can review the progress of the restore operation.

//NOTE: Restoring a volume from a backup file that resides in archival storage can take many minutes or hours depending on the archive tier and the restore priority. You can click the *Job Monitoring* tab to see the restore progress.
