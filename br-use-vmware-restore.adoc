Restore VMware workloads from snapshots, from a workload backup replicated to secondary storage, or from backups stored in object storage using NetApp Backup and Recovery. 

//You can restore a workload to the original working environment, to a different working environment that's using the same cloud account, or to an on-premises ONTAP system. 

//different types of restore operations, volume restore or file/folder restore, Browse and restore vs Search and restore)



.Restore from these locations

You can restore workloads from different starting locations: 

* Restore from a primary location (local snapshot)
* Restore from a replicated resource on secondary storage
* Restore from an object storage backup

.Restore to these points   

You can restore data to these points: 

* Restore to the original location
* Restore to an alternate location

.Restore from object storage considerations

If Ransomware Resilience is enabled for a backup file in object storage, you are asked to run an extra check before restoring. We recommend performing the scan.

TIP: You might pay extra fees to your cloud provider to access the backup file.

== How restoring workloads works

When you restore workloads, the following occurs: 

* When you restore a workload from a local backup file, NetApp Backup and Recovery creates a _new_ resource using the data from the backup. 

* When you restore from a replicated workload, you can restore the workload to the original system or to an on-premises ONTAP system.

* When you restore a backup from object storage, you can restore the data to the original system or to an on-premises ONTAP system.


//== When to use Quick Restore 

//When you restore a cloud backup to a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system using ONTAP 9.13.0 or greater or to an on-premises ONTAP system running ONTAP 9.14.1, you'll have the option to perform a _quick restore_ operation. The quick restore is ideal for disaster recovery situations where you need to provide access to a resource as soon as possible. A quick restore restores the metadata from the backup file instead of restoring the entire backup file. Quick restore is not recommended for performance or latency-sensitive applications, and it is not supported with backups in archived storage.

//NOTE: Quick restore is supported for FlexGroup volumes only if the source system from which the cloud backup was created was running ONTAP 9.12.1 or greater. And it is supported for SnapLock volumes only if the source system was running ONTAP 9.11.0 or greater.


//== Restore methods

//You can restore workloads using one of the following methods. Typically, choose a method based on your restore needs:

From the Restore page (Search & Restore), you can restore a resource by searching for the snapshot with filters, even if you do not remember its exact name, location, or last known date.

//* *From the Inventory page (also known as Browse & Restore)*: Use this when you need to restore a specific resource from the last week or month -- and you know the name and location of the resource, and the date when it was last in good shape. You browse through a list of resources to find the one you want to restore.

//Inventory is browse and restore. Restore page is Search and restore. 



== Restore workload data from the Restore option (Search & Restore)

Restore VMware workloads using the Restore option. You can search for the snapshot by its name or by using filters. 

*Required NetApp Console role*
Storage viewer, Backup and Recovery super admin, Backup and Recovery restore admin role. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about NetApp Console access roles for all services^].

.Steps

. From the NetApp Backup and Recovery menu, select *Restore*.
. From the drop-down list to the right of the name search field, select *VMware*. 
. Enter the name of the resource you want to restore or filter for the vCenter, datacenter, or datastore where the resource that you want to restore is located. 
+
A list of virtual machines appears that match your search criteria.

. Find the VM that you want to restore from in the list, and select the *Restore* button for that VM. 
+
A list of snapshots (restore points) created on that virtual machine appears.
. Enable the check box for the snapshot you want to restore.
. Select *Next*.
+

.. *Enable change storage location*: By default, the backup from object storage will be restored in the source SVM. Select this to choose alternate storage if the source storage is down or does not have enough space. Select the cluster, storage VM, aggregate, and volumes where you want to restore the snapshot. You can do this for storage layout 1 and 2. 
. In the Restore Destination details page, enter the following information:
.. *Destination settings*: Choose whether you want to restore the data to its original location or to an alternate location. For an alternate location, select the VM name, and enter the destination path where you want to restore the snapshot.
.. *Enable quick restore*: Select this to perform a quick restore operation. You can use the restored volumes and data immediately. Do not use this on volumes that require high performance because during the quick restore process, access to the data might be slower than usual. 
This option is available only if the source system from which the cloud backup was created was running ONTAP 9.13.0 or greater or to an on-premises ONTAP system running ONTAP 9.14.1.
