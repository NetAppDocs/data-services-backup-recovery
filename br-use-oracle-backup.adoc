Use NetApp Backup and Recovery to back up Oracle Database protection groups or databases from on-premises ONTAP systems to cloud storage, including Amazon S3, NetApp StorageGRID, Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, or ONTAP S3. NetApp Backup and Recovery backs up databases and log data in each protection group.

NOTE: To back up protection groups or single databases on a schedule, create policies that manage backup and restore operations. See link:br-use-policies-create.html[Create policies] for instructions.

* Create protection groups to manage the backup and restore operations for a set of resources. See link:br-use-kvm-protection-groups.html[Create and manage protection groups for Oracle workloads with NetApp Backup and Recovery] for more information.
