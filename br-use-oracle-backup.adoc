Back up Oracle Database protection groups or databases from on-premises ONTAP systems to Amazon Web Services S3, NetApp StorageGRID, Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, or ONTAP S3 to ensure that your data is protected. When you back up a protection group, the NetApp Console backs up the databases and log data contained in the protection group. 
//Backups are automatically generated and stored in an object store in your public or private cloud account. 

NOTE: To back up protection groups or single databases on a schedule, create policies that govern the backup and restore operations. See link:br-use-policies-create.html[Create policies] for instructions.

* Create protection groups to manage the backup and restore operations for a set of resources. See link:br-use-kvm-protection-groups.html[Create and manage protection groups for Oracle workloads with NetApp Backup and Recovery] for more information.
* Back up a protection group now (create an on-demand backup now).
* Back up a database now.
