[.lead]
Restore Microsoft SQL Server workloads from snapshot copies, from a workload backup replicated to secondary storage, or from backups stored in object storage using NetApp Backup and Recovery. You can restore a workload to the original system, to a different system that's using the same cloud account, or to an on-premises ONTAP system. 

//different types of restore operations, volume restore or file/folder restore, Browse and restore vs Search and restore)

.Restore from these locations

You can restore workloads from different starting locations: 

* Restore from a primary location
* Restore from a replicated resource
* Restore from an object store backup

.Restore to these points   

You can restore data to the latest snapshot or to these points: 

* Restore from snapshots
* Restore to a specific point in time. This is helpful if you know the name and location of the file, and the date when it was last in good shape. 
* Restore to the latest backup 

.Restore from object storage considerations

If you select a backup file in object storage, and Ransomware Resilience is active for that backup (if you enabled DataLock and Ransomware Resilience in the backup policy), then you are prompted to run an additional integrity check on the backup file before restoring the data. We recommend that you perform the scan. 

TIP: You'll incur extra egress costs from your cloud provider to access the contents of the backup file.




== How restoring workloads works

When you restore workloads, the following occurs: 

* When you restore a workload from a backup file, NetApp Backup and Recovery creates a _new_ resource using the data from the backup. 

* When you restore from a replicated workload, you can restore the workload to the original system or to an on-premises ONTAP system.

* When you restore a backup from object storage, you can restore the data to the original system or to an on-premises ONTAP system.


//== When to use Quick Restore 

//When you restore a cloud backup to a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system using ONTAP 9.13.0 or greater or to an on-premises ONTAP system running ONTAP 9.14.1, you'll have the option to perform a _quick restore_ operation. The quick restore is ideal for disaster recovery situations where you need to provide access to a resource as soon as possible. A quick restore restores the metadata from the backup file instead of restoring the entire backup file. Quick restore is not recommended for performance or latency-sensitive applications, and it is not supported with backups in archived storage.

//NOTE: Quick restore is supported for FlexGroup volumes only if the source system from which the cloud backup was created was running ONTAP 9.12.1 or greater. And it is supported for SnapLock volumes only if the source system was running ONTAP 9.11.0 or greater.


== Restore methods

You can restore workloads using one of the following methods. Typically, choose one of the following methods based on your restore needs:

* *From the Restore page*: Use this when you need to restore a resource, but you don't remember the exact name or the location in which it resides, or the date when it was last in good shape. You can search for the snapshot using filters. 
* *From the Inventory page*: Use this when you need to restore a specific resource from the last week or month -- and you know the name and location of the resource, and the date when it was last in good shape. You browse through a list of resources to find the one you want to restore.

//Inventory is browse and restore. Restore page is Search and restore. 

*Required NetApp Console role*
Storage viewer, Backup and Recovery super admin, or Backup and Recovery backup admin role. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about BlueXP access roles for all services^].

You'll see destination options next.
+
image:screen-br-restore-destination-original-location.png[A screenshot showing the Restore Destination details page.]


. In the Destination details page, enter the following information: 
** *Destination settings*: Choose whether you want to restore the data to its original location or to an alternate location. For an alternate location, select the host name and instance, enter the database name, and enter the destination path where you want to restore the snapshot.

** *Pre-restore options*: 
*** *Overwrite the database with the same name during restore*: During the restore, the original database name is preserved. 
*** *Retain SQL database replication settings*: Keeps the replication settings for the SQL database after the restore operation.
*** *Create transaction log backup before restore*: Creates a transaction log backup before the restore operation.*** *Quit restore if transaction log backup before restore fails*: Stops the restore operation if the transaction log backup fails.


*** *Prescript*: Enter the full path for a script that should be run before the restore operation, any arguments that the script takes, and how long to wait for the script to complete.

** *Post-restore options*: 
*** *Operational*, but unavailable for restoring additional transaction logs. This brings the database back online after transaction log backups are applied. 
*** *Non-operational*, but available for restoring additional transaction logs. Maintains the database in a non-operational state after the restore operation while restoring transaction log backups. This option is useful for restoring additional transaction logs.
*** *Read-only mode* and available for restoring additional transaction logs. Restores the database in a read-only mode and applies transaction log backups. 
*** *Postscript*: Enter the full path for a script that should be run after the restore operation and any arguments that the script takes.

 
. Select *Restore*.


=== Restore to specific point in time

NetApp Backup and Recovery uses logs and the most recent snapshots to create a point-in-time restore of your data. 

. Continuing from the Restore options page, select *Restore to specific point in time*. 
. Select *Next*.
+
image:screen-br-restore-point-in-time.png[A screenshot showing the Restore to a specific point in time page]

*** *Preserve original database name*: During the restore, the original database name is preserved. 
*** *Retain SQL database replication settings*: Keeps the replication settings for the SQL database after the restore operation.
*** *Prescript*: Enter the full path for a script that should be run before the restore operation, any arguments that the script takes, and how long to wait for the script to complete.
** *Post-restore options*: 
*** *Operational*, but unavailable for restoring additional transaction logs. This brings the database back online after transaction log backups are applied. 
*** *Non-operational*, but available for restoring additional transaction logs. Maintains the database in a non-operational state after the restore operation while restoring transaction log backups. This option is useful for restoring additional transaction logs.
*** *Read-only mode* and available for restoring additional transaction logs. Restores the database in a read-only mode and applies transaction log backups. 
*** *Postscript*: Enter the full path for a script that should be run after the restore operation and any arguments that the script takes.

 
. Select *Restore*.


=== Restore to the latest backup

//endif::azure[]
//ifdef::gcp[]
//link:reference-google-backup-tiers.html#restore-data-from-archival-storage[Learn more about restoring from Google archival storage]. Backup files in the Google Archive storage tier are restored almost immediately, and require no Restore Priority.
//endif::gcp[]

//.Steps
//. Click *Next* to choose whether you want to do a Normal restore or a Quick Restore process: 
//+
//image:screenshot_restore_browse_quick_restore.png[A screenshot showing the normal and Quick restore processes.]
//+
//* *Normal restore*: Use normal restore on volumes that require high performance. Volumes will not be available until the restore process is complete. 
//* *Quick restore*: Restored volumes and data will be available immediately. Do not use this on volumes that require high performance because during the quick restore process, access to the data might be slower than usual. 


//. Click *Restore* and you are returned to the Restore Dashboard so you can review the progress of the restore operation.

//NOTE: Restoring a volume from a backup file that resides in archival storage can take many minutes or hours depending on the archive tier and the restore priority. You can click the *Job Monitoring* tab to see the restore progress.
