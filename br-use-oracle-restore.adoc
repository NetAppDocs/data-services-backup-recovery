= Restore Oracle databases with NetApp Backup and Recovery

[.lead]
Restore Oracle databases from snapshots, from a backup replicated to secondary storage, or from backups stored in object storage using NetApp Backup and Recovery.

.Restore from these locations

You can restore databases from different starting locations: 

* Restore from a primary location (local snapshot)
* Restore from a replicated resource on secondary storage
* Restore from an object storage backup

.Restore to these points   

You can restore data to the original location; restoring to an alternate location is not available in this private preview release.

* Restore to the original location
//* Restore to an alternate location

//.Restore from object storage considerations

//If you select a backup file in object storage, and ransomware protection is active for that backup (if you enabled DataLock and Ransomware Resilience in the backup policy), then you are prompted to run an additional integrity check on the backup file before restoring the data. We recommend that you perform the scan. 

//TIP: You'll incur extra egress costs from your cloud provider to access the contents of the backup file.


== How restoring Oracle databases works

When you restore Oracle databases, the following occurs: 

* When you restore a database from a local snapshot, NetApp Backup and Recovery creates a _new_ resource using the data from the backup. 

* When you restore from replicated storage, you can restore it to the original location.

* When you restore a backup from object storage, you can restore the data to the source storage or to an on-premises ONTAP system and recover the database from there.


//== When to use Quick Restore 

//When you restore a cloud backup to a Cloud Volumes ONTAP system using ONTAP 9.13.0 or greater or to an on-premises ONTAP system running ONTAP 9.14.1, you'll have the option to perform a _quick restore_ operation. The quick restore is ideal for disaster recovery situations where you need to provide access to a resource as soon as possible. A quick restore restores the metadata from the backup file instead of restoring the entire backup file. Quick restore is not recommended for performance or latency-sensitive applications, and it is not supported with backups in archived storage.

//NOTE: Quick restore is supported for FlexGroup volumes only if the source system from which the cloud backup was created was running ONTAP 9.12.1 or greater. And it is supported for SnapLock volumes only if the source system was running ONTAP 9.11.0 or greater.


//== Restore methods

//You can restore workloads using one of the following methods. Typically, choose a method based on your restore needs:

From the Restore page (also known as Search & Restore), you can restore a database, even if you don't remember the exact name, the location in which it resides, or the date when it was last in good shape. You can search for the database using filters. 

//* *From the Inventory page (also known as Browse & Restore)*: Use this when you need to restore a specific resource from the last week or month -- and you know the name and location of the resource, and the date when it was last in good shape. You browse through a list of resources to find the one you want to restore.

//Inventory is browse and restore. Restore page is Search and restore. 

== Restore an Oracle database

Depending on your needs, restore an Oracle database to a specific point in time, to a specific system change number (SCN), or to the last good state. You can also simply restore the database from snapshots and skip the automated recovery process. You might want to skip the automated recovery process if you want to perform recovery manually. You can search for the database using its name or with specific filters.
