The following actions and configurations are not supported in the private preview version of KVM workloads in NetApp Backup and Recovery:

* Clone, mount, or unmount VMs

== Unsupported legacy NetApp Console accounts
Legacy NetApp Console accounts don't support the features required to protect KVM workloads. Check if you are using a legacy account in the Console web UI. If you have a legacy Console account, create a new account before protecting KVM workloads.

.Steps

. From the NetApp Console menu, select *Administration > Identity and access*.
. Under *Organization*, check to see if an *Account ID* is shown next to the organization ID. 
+
If an *Account ID* is shown, you are using a legacy account.
. If you are using a legacy account, do the following:
.. Log out of the Console and then browse to the https://console.netapp.com/[Console login page^].
.. Select *Sign up* to create a new account.
