Backups of your ONTAP volume data are stored as snapshots, on replicated volumes, or in object storage. You can restore data from any of these locations at a specific point in time. With NetApp Backup and Recovery, you can restore an entire volume, a folder, or individual files as needed.

NOTE: To switch to and from NetApp Backup and Recovery workloads, refer to link:br-start-switch-ui.html[Switch to different NetApp Backup and Recovery workloads].

* You can restore a *volume* (as a new volume) to the original system, to a different system that's using the same cloud account, or to an on-premises ONTAP system.

* You can restore a *folder* to a volume in the original system, to a volume in a different system that's using the same cloud account, or to a volume on an on-premises ONTAP system.

* You can restore *files* to a volume in the original system, to a volume in a different system that's using the same cloud account, or to a volume on an on-premises ONTAP system.

You need a valid NetApp Backup and Recovery license to restore data to a production system.

To summarize, these are the valid flows you can use to restore volume data to an ONTAP system:

* Backup file -> restored volume
* Replicated volume -> restored volume
* Snapshot -> restored volume

NOTE: If the restore operation does not complete, wait until the Job Monitor shows "Failed" before you retry the restore operation.

NOTE: For limitations related to restoring ONTAP data, see link:br-reference-limitations.html[Backup and restore limitations for ONTAP volumes].

== The Restore Dashboard

You use the Restore Dashboard to perform volume, folder, and file restore operations. To access the Restore Dashboard, select *Backup and recovery* from the Console menu, and then select the *Restore* tab. You can also select image:icon-options-vertical.gif[More button] > *View Restore Dashboard* from the Backup and recovery service from the Services panel.

NOTE: NetApp Backup and Recovery must already be activated for at least one system and initial backup files must exist.

The Restore Dashboard provides two different ways to restore data from backup files: *Browse & Restore* and *Search & Restore*.

== Comparing Browse & Restore and Search & Restore

In broad terms, _Browse & Restore_ is typically better when you need to restore a specific volume, folder, or file from the last week or month -- and you know the name and location of the file, and the date when it was last in good shape. _Search & Restore_ is typically better when you need to restore a volume, folder, or file, but you don't remember the exact name, or the volume in which it resides, or the date when it was last in good shape.

This table provides a feature comparison of the two methods.

| Browse & Restore
| Search & Restore

| Browse through a folder-style structure to find the volume, folder, or file within a single backup file. | Search for a volume, folder, or file across *all backup files* by partial or full volume name, partial or full folder/file name, size range, and additional search filters.
| Does not handle file recovery if the file has been deleted or renamed, and the user doesn't know the original file name | Handles newly created/deleted/renamed directories and newly created/deleted/renamed files
| Quick restore is supported. | Quick restore is not supported.

This table provides a list of valid restore operations based on the location where your backup files reside.

Before you use either restore method, configure your environment to meet the resource requirements. See the following sections for details.
