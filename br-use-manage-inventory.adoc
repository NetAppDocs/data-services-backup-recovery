NetApp Backup and Recovery enables you to manage your Microsoft SQL Server workload host information, database information, and instances information. You can view, edit, and delete protection settings of your inventory.      

You can accomplish the following tasks related to managing your inventory: 

* Manage host information
** Suspend schedules
** Edit or delete hosts

* Manage instances information 
** Associate credentials with a resource
** Back up now by starting an on-demand backup
** Edit protection settings

* Manage database information

* Configure the log directory (from Inventory > Hosts). If you want to back up logs for your database hosts in the snapshot, first configure the logs in NetApp Backup and Recovery. For details, refer to link:br-start-setup.html[Configure NetApp Backup and Recovery settings].  



== Manage host information 

You can manage host information to ensure that the right hosts are protected. You can view, edit, and delete host information. 

*Required NetApp Console role*
Storage viewer, Backup and Recovery super admin, Backup and Recovery backup admin, Backup and Recovery restore admin, or Backup and Recovery clone admin role. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about BlueXP access roles for all services^].

=== Manage hosts 

You can manage the hosts that are discovered in your system. You can manage them separately or as a group. 

TIP: You can manage only those hosts that show an "Unmanaged" status in the Hosts column. If the status is "Managed", it means that the host is already being managed by NetApp Backup and Recovery.

After you manage the hosts in NetApp Backup and Recovery, SnapCenter no longer manages the resources on those hosts.
