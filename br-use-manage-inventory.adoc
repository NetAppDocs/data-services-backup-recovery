NetApp Backup and Recovery enables you to manage your Microsoft SQL Server workload host information, database information, and instances information. You can view, edit, and delete protection settings of your inventory.      

You can accomplish the following tasks related to managing your inventory:

You can manage the hosts that are discovered in your system. You can manage them separately or as a group.

After you manage the hosts in NetApp Backup and Recovery, SnapCenter no longer manages the resources on those hosts.
