After you set up NetApp Console, configure Backup and Recovery settings. Add credentials for host resources, import SnapCenter resources, configure log directories, and set VMware vCenter settings. Complete these steps before backing up or recovering data.

* <<Add credentials for host resources>> for any Windows, Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, or Linux hosts that NetApp Backup and Recovery needs to authenticate with. This includes Windows guest OS credentials used when restoring guest files or folders.
* <<Maintain VMware vCenter settings>>.
* <<Import and manage SnapCenter host resources>>. (Microsoft SQL Server workloads only)
//* link:br-use-manage-execution-hook-templates.html[Set up script execution hooks] to run scripts before and after backup jobs. (Kubernetes workloads only)
* <<Configure log directories in snapshots for Windows hosts>>.
//* Enable DataLock and integrity scanning. 
//* <<Enable the Certificate Authority certificates>>.


*Required NetApp Console role*
Backup and Recovery super admin, Backup and Recovery backup admin, Backup and Recovery restore admin.

== Add credentials for host resources

Add credentials for host resources. NetApp Backup and Recovery uses these credentials to discover workloads and apply backup policies.

If you don't have credentials, create them with permissions to access and manage host workloads.

You need to configure the following types of credentials: 

* Microsoft SQL Server credentials
* SnapCenter Windows host credentials
* Windows guest OS credentials used when restoring guest files or folders
* Oracle Database credentials
* Linux host credentials

.Steps
. From the NetApp Backup and Recovery menu, select *Settings*.
. Select the down arrow for *Credentials*.
. Select *Add new credentials*.
. Enter information for the credentials. Different fields appear depending on the Authentication mode you select. Hover over the Information *i* icon for more information about the fields. 
* *Credentials name*: Enter a name for the credentials.
* *Authentication mode*: Select *Windows*, *Microsoft SQL*, *Oracle Database*, or *Linux*. 
+
TIP: For Microsoft SQL Server workloads, you need to enter credentials for both Windows and Microsoft SQL Server, so you'll need to add two sets of credentials.

. Select *Add*.

=== Edit credentials for host resources

You can later edit the password for any credentials that you have created.

.Steps
. From the NetApp Backup and Recovery menu, select *Settings*.
. Select the down arrow to expand the *Credentials* section. 
. Select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *Edit credentials*.   
+
* *Password*: Enter the password for the credentials.

. Select *Save*.

== Maintain VMware vCenter settings 

Provide VMware vCenter credentials to discover workloads for backup. If you don't have credentials, create them with permissions to access and manage the VMware vCenter Server workloads.

.Steps
. From the NetApp Backup and Recovery menu, select *Settings*.

. Select the down arrow to expand the *VMware vCenter* section.


. Select *Add vCenter*.

. Enter the VMware vCenter Server information.
* *vCenter FQDN or IP address*: Enter an FQDN name or the IP address for the VMware vCenter Server.
* *Username* and *Password*: Enter the username and password for the VMware vCenter Server.
* *Port*: Enter the port number for the VMware vCenter Server.
* *Protocol*: Select *HTTP* or *HTTPS*. 

. Select *Add*.

== Import and manage SnapCenter host resources

If you previously used SnapCenter to back up your resources, you can import and manage those resources in NetApp Backup and Recovery. This option enables you to import SnapCenter server information to register multiple SnapCenter servers and discover database workloads.

This is a two-part process:

* Import SnapCenter Server application and host resources
* Manage selected SnapCenter host resources

=== Import SnapCenter Server application and host resources

This first step imports host resources from SnapCenter and displays those resources in the NetApp Backup and Recovery Inventory page. At that point, the resources are not yet managed by NetApp Backup and Recovery.

TIP: After you import SnapCenter host resources, NetApp Backup and Recovery does not take over protection management. To do so, you must explicitly select to manage these resources in NetApp Backup and Recovery.  

.Steps 

. From the NetApp Backup and Recovery menu, select *Settings*. 
. Select the down arrow to expand the *Import from SnapCenter* section.
. Select *Import from SnapCenter* to import the SnapCenter resources.
. Enter *SnapCenter application credentials*:
.. *SnapCenter FQDN or IP address*: Enter the FQDN or IP address of the SnapCenter application itself.
.. *Port*: Enter the port number for the SnapCenter Server.
.. *Username* and *Password*: Enter the username and password for the SnapCenter Server.
.. *Console agent*: Select the Console agent for SnapCenter.

. Enter *SnapCenter server host credentials*:
.. *Existing credentials*: If you select this option, you can use the existing credentials that you have already added. Enter the credentials name. 
.. *Add new credentials*: If you don't have existing SnapCenter host credentials, you can add new credentials. Enter the credentials name, authentication mode, user name, and password.

. Select *Import* to validate your entries and register the SnapCenter Server.
+
NOTE: If the SnapCenter Server is already registered, you can  update the existing registration details.

.Result
The Inventory page shows the imported SnapCenter resources.

=== Manage SnapCenter host resources

After you import the SnapCenter resources, manage those host resources in NetApp Backup and Recovery. After you select to manage those imported resources, NetApp Backup and Recovery can back up and recover the resources that you are importing from SnapCenter. You no longer need to manage those resources in SnapCenter Server. 

.Steps 
. After you import the SnapCenter resources, on the Inventory page that appears, select the SnapCenter resources that you imported that you want to have NetApp Backup and Recovery manage from now on.  

. Select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *Manage* to manage the resources.   

. Select *Manage in NetApp Console*. 
+
The Inventory page shows *Managed* under the host name to indicate that the selected host resources are now managed by NetApp Backup and Recovery.

=== Edit imported SnapCenter resources

You can later re-import SnapCenter resources our edit the imported SnapCenter resources to update the registration details.

You can change only the port and password details for the SnapCenter Server.

.Steps
. From the NetApp Backup and Recovery menu, select *Settings*. 
. Select the down arrow for *Import from SnapCenter*.
+ 
The Import from SnapCenter page shows all previous imports. 

. Select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *Edit* to update the resources.   

. Update the SnapCenter password and port details, as needed.
. Select *Import*. 

== Configure log directories in snapshots for Windows hosts

Before you create policies for Windows hosts, you should configure log directories in snapshots for Windows hosts. Log directories are used to store the logs that are generated during the backup process. 

.Steps
. From the NetApp Backup and Recovery menu, select *Inventory*.

. From the Inventory page, select a workload and then select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *View details* to display the workload details.   

. From the Inventory details page showing Microsoft SQL Server, select the Hosts tab. 
 

. From the Inventory details page, select a host and select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *Configure log directory*.   

. Either browse or enter the path for the log directory.
. Select *Save*.
