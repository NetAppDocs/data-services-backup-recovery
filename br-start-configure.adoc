[.lead]
After you set up NetApp Console, configure the backup and recovery settings, which include adding credentials for host resources, importing SnapCenter resources, configuring log directories, and configuring VMware vCenter settings. You should do this before you actively start backing up and recovering your data. 

* <<Add credentials for host resources>> for the Windows and SQL Server hosts that you imported from SnapCenter and add credentials. (Microsoft SQL Server workloads only)
* <<Maintain VMware vCenter settings>>.
* <<Import and manage SnapCenter host resources>>. (Microsoft SQL Server workloads only)
//* link:br-use-manage-execution-hook-templates.html[Set up script execution hooks] to run scripts before and after backup jobs. (Kubernetes workloads only)
* <<Configure log directories in snapshots for Windows hosts>>.
//* Enable DataLock and integrity scanning. 
//* <<Enable the Certificate Authority certificates>>.


*Required NetApp Console role*
Backup and Recovery super admin, Backup and Recovery backup admin, Backup and Recovery restore admin. Learn about link:reference-roles.html[Backup and recovery roles and privileges]. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/bluexp-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about NetApp Console access roles for all services^].  

== Add credentials for host resources

Add credentials for the host resources that you want to import from SnapCenter. Host credentials are used to discover new workloads and apply backup policies.

If you don't already have credentials, you can create them. These credentials must have required permissions to access and manage the host workloads.

You need to configure the following types of credentials: 

* Microsoft SQL Server credentials
* SnapCenter Windows host credentials 

//After NetApp Backup and Recovery discovers hosts, you can change the password, but you cannot delete the credentials for that host. 

.Steps
. From the NetApp Backup and Recovery menu, select *Settings*.

== Import and manage SnapCenter host resources

If you previously used SnapCenter to back up your resources, you can import and manage those resources in NetApp Backup and Recovery. With this option, you can import SnapCenter Server information to register multiple Snapcenter servers and discover the database workloads.

This is a two-part process:

* Import SnapCenter Server application and host resources
* Manage selected SnapCenter host resources

=== Import SnapCenter Server application and host resources

This first step imports host resources from SnapCenter and displays those resources in the NetApp Backup and Recovery Inventory page. At that point, the resources are not yet managed by NetApp Backup and Recovery.

TIP: After you import SnapCenter host resources, NetApp Backup and Recovery does not take over protection management. To do so, you must explicitly select to manage these resources in NetApp Backup and Recovery.  

.Steps 

. From the NetApp Backup and Recovery menu, select *Settings*. 
+
image:../media/screen-br-settings-all.png[Settings option showing the options]
. Select the down arrow to expand the *Import from SnapCenter* section.
+
image:../media/screen-br-settings-import-snapcenter.png[Settings option to import SnapCenter Server resources]

. Select *Import from SnapCenter* to import the SnapCenter resources.
+
image:../media/screen-br-settings-import-snapcenter-details.png[Settings option to import SnapCenter Server resources]

. Enter *SnapCenter application credentials*:
.. *SnapCenter FQDN or IP address*: Enter the FQDN or IP address of the SnapCenter application itself.
.. *Port*: Enter the port number for the SnapCenter Server.
.. *Username* and *Password*: Enter the username and password for the SnapCenter Server.
.. *Console agent*: Select the Console agent for SnapCenter.


. Enter *SnapCenter server host credentials*:
.. *Existing credentials*: If you select this option, you can use the existing credentials that you have already added. Enter the credentials name. 
.. *Add new credentials*: If you don't have existing SnapCenter host credentials, you can add new credentials. Enter the credentials name, authentication mode, user name, and password.

. Select *Import* to validate your entries and register the SnapCenter Server.
+
NOTE: If the SnapCenter Server is already registered, you can  update the existing registration details.

.Result
The Inventory page shows the imported SnapCenter resources.

=== Manage SnapCenter host resources

After you import the SnapCenter resources, manage those host resources in NetApp Backup and Recovery. After you select to manage those imported resources, NetApp Backup and Recovery can back up and recover the resources that you are importing from SnapCenter. You no longer need to manage those resources in SnapCenter Server. 

.Steps 
. After you import the SnapCenter resources, on the Inventory page that appears, select the SnapCenter resources that you imported that you want to have NetApp Backup and Recovery manage from now on.  

. Select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *Manage* to manage the resources.   
+
image:../media/screen-br-inventory-manage-host.png[Inventory page showing the imported SnapCenter resources and the Manage option]

. Select *Manage in NetApp Console*. 
+
The Inventory page shows *Managed* under the host name to indicate that the selected host resources are now managed by NetApp Backup and Recovery.


=== Edit imported SnapCenter resources

You can later re-import SnapCenter resources our edit the imported SnapCenter resources to update the registration details.

You can change only the port and password details for the SnapCenter Server.


.Steps
. From the NetApp Backup and Recovery menu, select *Settings*. 
. Select the down arrow for *Import from SnapCenter*.
+ 
The Import from SnapCenter page shows all previous imports.
