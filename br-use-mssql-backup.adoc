Back up Microsoft SQL Server application data from on-premises ONTAP systems to Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or StorageGRID. The system automatically creates backups and stores them in an object store in your cloud account for data protection. 

* To back up workloads on a schedule, create policies that manage backup and restore operations. See link:br-use-policies-create.html[Create policies] for instructions.
* Configure the log directory for discovered hosts before starting a backup.
