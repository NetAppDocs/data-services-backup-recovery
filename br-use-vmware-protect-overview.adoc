Protect your VMware VMs and datastores with NetApp Backup and Recovery. NetApp Backup and Recovery provides fast, space-efficient, crash-consistent, and VM-consistent backup and restore operations. You can back up VMware workloads to Amazon Web Services S3 or StorageGRID and restore VMware workloads back to an on-premises VMware host. 

NOTE: This version of NetApp Backup and Recovery supports only VMware vCenter and does not discover vVols or VMs on vVols.  

//You can back up VMware workloads to Amazon Web Services S3 or StorageGRID and restore VMware workloads back to the the same or alternate on-premises VMware host. 

//NetApp Backup and Recovery provides fast, space-efficient, crash-consistent, and VM-consistent backup and restore operations for VMs, datastores, and VMDKs. 


Use NetApp Backup and Recovery to implement a 3-2-1 strategy, where you have 3 copies of your source data on 2 different storage systems along with 1 copy in the cloud. The benefits of the 3-2-1 approach include:

* Multiple data copies protect against internal and external cybersecurity threats.
* Using different types of media helps you recover if one type fails.
* You can quickly restore from the onsite copy, and use the offsite copies if the onsite copy is compromised.
