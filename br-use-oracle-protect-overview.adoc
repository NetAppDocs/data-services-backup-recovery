Protect Oracle databases and logs using NetApp Backup and Recovery. Get fast, space-efficient, crash-consistent, and database-consistent backups and restores. Back up Oracle workloads to AWS S3, NetApp StorageGRID, Azure Blob Storage, or ONTAP S3. Restore backups to an on-premises Oracle host.

Use NetApp Backup and Recovery to implement a 3-2-1 protection strategy, where you have 3 copies of your source data on 2 different storage systems along with 1 copy in the cloud. The benefits of the 3-2-1 approach include:

* Multiple data copies protect against internal and external cybersecurity threats.
* Using different types of media helps you recover if one type fails.
* You can quickly restore from the onsite copy, and use the offsite copies if the onsite copy is compromised.
