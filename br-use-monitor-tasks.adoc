[.lead]
With NetApp Backup and Recovery, monitor local snapshots, replications, and backup jobs you start. Track restore jobs you initiate. View jobs that are complete, in progress, or failed to help diagnose problems. Enable email notifications in the NetApp Console Notification Center to stay informed about system activity when not logged in. Use the Console Timeline to see details of all actions started from the UI or API.

NetApp Backup and Recovery keeps job information for 15 days, then deletes the job information and removes it from the Job Monitor. 

*Required NetApp Console role*
Storage viewer, Backup and Recovery super admin, Backup and Recovery backup admin, Backup and Recovery restore admin, Backup and Recovery clone admin, or Backup and Recovery viewer role. Learn about link:reference-roles.html[Backup and recovery roles and privileges]. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about NetApp Console access roles for all services^]. 

== View job status on the Job Monitor

You can view a list of all the snapshot, replication, backup to object storage, and restore operations and their current status in the *Job Monitoring* tab. This includes operations from your Cloud Volumes ONTAP, on-premises ONTAP, applications, and virtual machines. Each operation, or job, has a unique ID and a status. 

The status can be:

* Success
* In Progress
* Queued
* Warning
* Failed

Snapshots, replications, backups to object storage, and restore operations that you initiated from the NetApp Backup and Recovery UI and API are available in the Job Monitoring tab. 

NOTE: If you have upgraded your ONTAP systems to 9.13.x and do not see ongoing scheduled backup operations in the Job Monitor, restart NetApp Backup and Recovery. link:reference-restart-backup.html[Learn how to restart NetApp Backup and Recovery].

.Steps

. From the NetApp Backup and Recovery menu, select *Monitoring*.
. To show additional columns (System, SVM, User Name, Workload, Policy Name, Snapshot Label), select the plus sign.

=== Search and filter the list of jobs

You can filter the operations on the Job Monitoring page using several filters, such as policy, snapshot label, type of operation (protection, restore, retention, or other) and protection type (local snapshot, replication, or backup to the cloud). 

By default, the Job Monitoring page shows protection and recovery jobs from the last 24 hours. You can change the timeframe using the Timeframe filter.

.Steps

. From the NetApp Backup and Recovery menu, select *Monitoring*.
. To sort the results differently, select each column heading to sort by Status, Start Time, Resource Name, and more. 

. If you're looking for specific jobs, select the *Advanced Search & Filtering* area to open the Search panel. 
+
Use this panel to enter a free text search for any resource; for example "volume 1" or "application 3". You can also filter the jobs list according to the items in the drop-down menus.
+
Most of the filters are self-explanatory. The filter for "Workload" enables you to view jobs in the following categories:

* ONTAP volumes (Cloud Volumes ONTAP and on-premises ONTAP volumes)
* Microsoft SQL Server 
* Virtual Machines
* Kubernetes

+
[TIP]
====
* You can search for data within a specific "SVM" only if you have first selected a System.
* You can search using the "Protection type" filter only when you have selected the "Type" of "Protection".
====

. To update the page immediately, select the image:button_refresh.png[Refresh] button. Otherwise, this page refreshes every 15 minutes so that you'll always see the most recent job status results. 

=== View job details

You can view details corresponding to a specific completed job. You can export details for a particular job in a JSON format. 

You can view details such as job type (scheduled or on-demand), SnapMirror backup type (initial or periodic) start and end times, duration, amount of transferred data from system to object storage, average transfer rate, policy name, retention lock enabled, ransomware scan performed, protection source details, and protection target details. 

Restore jobs show details such as backup target provider (Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, on-premises), S3 bucket name, SVM name, source volume name, destination volume, snapshot label, recovered objects count, file names, file sizes, last modification date, and full file path. 

.Steps 

. From the NetApp Backup and Recovery menu, select *Monitoring*.
. Select the name of the job. 
. Select the Actions menu image:icon-action.png[Actions icon] and select *View Details*. 
. Expand each section to see details. 

=== Download Job Monitoring results as a report

You can download the contents of the main Job Monitoring page as a report after you filter or sort the results. NetApp Backup and Recovery generates and downloads a .CSV file that you can review and send to other groups as needed. The .CSV file includes up to 10,000 rows of data.

From the Job Monitoring Details information, you can download a JSON file containing details for a single job. 

.Steps

. From the NetApp Backup and Recovery menu, select *Monitoring*.
. To download a CSV file for all jobs, select the Download button and locate the file in your download directory. 
. To download a JSON file for a single job, select the Actions menu image:icon-action.png[Actions icon] for the job, select *Download JSON File*, and locate the file in your download directory.  

== Review retention (backup lifecycle) jobs

Monitor retention (_backup lifecycle_) flows to check backups, keep them safe, and support audits. Identify when backup copies expire to track the lifecycle. 

A backup lifecycle job tracks all snapshots that are deleted or in the queue to be deleted. Beginning with ONTAP 9.13, you can view all job types called "Retention" on the Job Monitoring page.

The "Retention" job type captures all snapshot deletion jobs initiated on a volume that is protected by NetApp Backup and Recovery.  

.Steps

. From the NetApp Backup and Recovery menu, select *Monitoring*.
. Select the *Advanced Search & Filtering* area to open the Search panel. 
. Select "Retention" as the job type. 

== Review backup and restore alerts in the NetApp Console Notification Center

The NetApp Console Notification Center tracks the progress of backup and restore jobs that you've initiated so you can verify whether the operation was successful or not. 

You can view alerts in the Notification Center and configure the Console to send email alerts for important system activity, even when you are not logged in. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/task-monitor-cm-operations.html[Learn more about the Notification Center and how to send alert emails for backup and restore jobs^].

The Notification Center displays numerous snapshot, replication, backup to cloud, and restore events, but only certain events trigger email alerts:

[cols="1,2,1,1",options="header"]

|===

NOTE: Beginning with ONTAP 9.13.0, all alerts appear for Cloud Volumes ONTAP and on-premises ONTAP systems. For systems with Cloud Volumes ONTAP 9.13.0 and on-premises ONTAP, only the alert related to "Restore job completed, but with warnings" appears. 

By default, NetApp Console organization and account admins receive emails for all "Critical" and "Recommendation" alerts. By default, the system does not set up other users and recipients to receive notification emails. Configure email alerts for any Console users in your NetApp Cloud Account or to other recipients who need to know about backup and restore activity. 

To receive the NetApp Backup and Recovery email alerts, you'll need to select the notification severity types "Critical", "Warning", and "Error" in the Notifications settings page.

https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/task-monitor-cm-operations.html[Learn how to send alert emails for backup and restore jobs^].

.Steps 

. From the Console menu, select the (image:icon_bell.png[notification bell]).
. Review the notifications.

== Review operation activity in Console Timeline

You can view details of backup and restore operations for further investigation in the Console Timeline. The Console Timeline provides details of each event, whether user-initiated or system-initiated and shows actions initiated in the UI or via the API.
