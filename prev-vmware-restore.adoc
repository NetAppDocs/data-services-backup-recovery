[.lead]
You can restore virtual machines data from the cloud back to the on-premises vCenter Server with NetApp Backup and Recovery. You can restore the virtual machine to the exact same location from where the backup was taken or to an alternate location. If the virtual machine was backed up using archival policy, then you can set the archival restore priority. 

NOTE: You cannot restore virtual machines that span across datastores.

NOTE: To switch to and from NetApp Backup and Recovery workloads, refer to link:br-start-switch-ui.html[Switch to different NetApp Backup and Recovery workloads].

.Before you begin
* Ensure that you have met all the link:prev-vmware-prereqs.html[virtual machine protection requirements] before backing up datastores to the cloud.
* If you are restoring to an alternate location:
** Ensure that the source and destination vCenters are in linked mode.
** Ensure that the source and destination cluster details are added in the NetApp Console *Systems* page and in linked mode vCenters in both SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere host.
** Ensure the system is added for the other location in the Console *Systems* page.

.Steps

. In the Console UI, select *Protection* > *Backup and Recovery* > *Virtual Machines* > *SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere* and select the SnapCenter Plug-in for VMware vSphere host.

NOTE: If you move a virtual machine using VMware vSphere vMotion and restore it from the Console, Backup and Recovery restores it to the original backup location.
