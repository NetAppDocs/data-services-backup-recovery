== Suspend a protection group's backup schedule

Suspending a protection group pauses the scheduled backups for the protection group. You might want to suspend a protection group if you want to temporarily stop backups for the workloads in that group. 

The protection status changes to "Under maintenance" when you suspend a protection group. You can resume the backup schedule at any time.

. Select a workload to view the protection details.
. Select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *View details*.
. Select the *Protection groups* tab.
. Select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *Suspend protection group*.

. Review the confirmation message and select *Suspend*. 


== Resume a protection group's backup schedule

Resuming a suspended protection group restarts the scheduled backups for the protection group.  

The protection status changes from "Under maintenance" when you suspend a protection group to "Protected" when you resume it. You can resume the backup schedule at any time.

.Steps
. From the NetApp Backup and Recovery menu, select *Inventory*.

. Select a workload to view the protection details.
. Select the Actions icon image:../media/icon-action.png[Actions option] > *View details*.
