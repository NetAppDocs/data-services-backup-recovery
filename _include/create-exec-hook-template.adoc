== Create an execution hook template
You can create a custom execution hook template that you can use to perform actions before or after a data protection operation on an application. 

NOTE: Templates that you create here are only usable when protecting Kubernetes workloads.

.Steps

. In the Console, go to *Protection* > *Backup and recovery*.
. Select the *Settings* tab.
. Expand the *Execution hook template* section.
. Select *Create execution hook template*.
. Enter a name for the execution hook.
. Optionally, choose a type of hook. For example, a post-restore hook is run after the restore operation is complete.
. In the *Script* text box, enter the executable shell script that you want to run as part of the execution hook template. Optionally, you can select *Upload script* to upload a script file instead.
. Select *Create*.
+
After you create the template, it appears in the list of templates in the *Execution hook template* section.
