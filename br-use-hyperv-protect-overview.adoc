Protect your Hyper-V VMs with NetApp Backup and Recovery. NetApp Backup and Recovery provides fast, space-efficient, crash-consistent, and VM-consistent backup and restore operations for both standalone and FCI cluster instances. 

You can back up Hyper-V workloads to Amazon Web Services S3 or StorageGRID and restore Hyper-V workloads back to an on-premises Hyper-V host.

Use NetApp Backup and Recovery to implement a 3-2-1 protection strategy, where you have 3 copies of your source data on 2 different storage systems along with 1 copy in the cloud. The benefits of the 3-2-1 approach include:
//The benefits of using NetApp Backup and Recovery to protect your Hyper-V resources include:

* Multiple data copies provide multi-layer protection against both internal (insider) and external cybersecurity threats.
* Multiple media types ensure failover viability in the case of physical or logical failure of one media type.
* The onsite copy facilitates quick restores, with the offsite copies available just in case the onsite copy is compromised.

When you add Hyper-V hosts and discover resources, NetApp Backup and Recovery installs the NetApp Hyper-V plug-in and the NetApp SnapCenter Windows FileSystem plug-in on the Hyper-V host to help with managing and protecting virtual machines.
