NetApp Backup and Recovery enables you to discover and manage your Kubernetes clusters so that you can protect resources hosted by the clusters. 

.Required NetApp Console role

Organization admin or SnapCenter admin. link:reference-roles.html[Learn about NetApp Backup and Recovery access roles]. https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/console-setup-admin/reference-iam-predefined-roles.html[Learn about NetApp Console access roles for all services^].

== Edit Kubernetes cluster information
You can edit a cluster if you need to change its name. 

.Steps

. In NetApp Backup and Recovery, select *Inventory* > *Clusters*.
. In the list of clusters, choose a cluster you want to edit and select the associated Actions menu.
. Select *Edit cluster*.
. Make any required changes to the cluster name. The cluster name needs to match the name that you used with the Helm command during the discovery process.
. Select *Done*.

== Remove a Kubernetes cluster
To stop protecting a Kubernetes cluster, disable protection and delete associated applications, then remove the cluster from NetApp Backup and Recovery. NetApp Backup and Recovery does not delete the cluster or its resources; it only removes the cluster from the NetApp Console inventory.

.Steps

. In NetApp Backup and Recovery, select *Inventory* > *Clusters*.
. In the list of clusters, choose a cluster you want to edit and select the associated Actions menu.
. Select *Remove cluster*.
. Review the information in the confirmation dialog box, and select *Remove*.
